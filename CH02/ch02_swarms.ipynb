        "# About this Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shows how to build and compile a **multi-agent swarm** using the `create_swarm` from [LangGraph Multi-Agent Swarm library](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-swarm-py). A swarm is a simple orchestration construct that allows multiple agents to collaborate, with one agent active by default and the others available to take over as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What it shows\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Agent collaboration**: defines a swarm with two agents (`research_assistant` and `writer_assistant`).\n",
        "* **Default active agent**: sets the `research_assistant` as the one that starts the conversation.\n",
        "* **Compilation step**: calling `.compile()` finalizes the swarm into an executable app/graph that can process inputs and route them between agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How it works\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define agents**: elsewhere in the code, `research_assistant` and `writer_assistant` are each defined as tool-enabled agents with their own prompts or roles.\n",
        "2. **Swarm creation**: `create_swarm()` takes these agent objects and constructs a collaborative structure.\n",
        "3. **Default activation**: `default_active_agent=\"research_assistant\"` ensures that research is initiated first, and only when needed does control move to the `writer_assistant`.\n",
        "4. **Compilation**: `.compile()` returns a runnable object (often a LangGraph app) that manages state, routing, and message passing across agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why this pattern\n",
        "\n",
        "* Keeps roles **modular**: each agent has its own tools and responsibilities.\n",
        "* Provides **coordination**: the swarm acts as a supervisor that manages turn-taking.\n",
        "* Easy to **extend**: more agents (editors, reviewers, validators) can be added without changing the orchestration logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Extend and adapt\n",
        "\n",
        "* Add a **validator agent** to check factual accuracy before the writer finalizes.\n",
        "* Change the **default active agent** if you want drafting to begin before research.\n",
        "* Add **routing rules** or scoring functions to decide which agent to hand off to.\n",
        "* Persist swarm state with a checkpointer so multi-turn tasks can span sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements and notes\n",
        "\n",
        "* Requires `langgraph_swarm` or equivalent utilities installed.\n",
        "* The agents passed to `create_swarm` must already be defined and tool-bound.\n",
        "* Swarm behavior depends on how the agents are prompted—clear role definitions improve collaboration."

regulatory approaches\\nRestrictions\\nCross-border business\\n\\n\\n\\nApproaches and developments\\nDuring 2023, despite the global economic slowdown caused by interest rate hikes and inflation and the moderate growth of the Swiss economy in 2023, the Swiss fintech sector has grown steadily, especially in the field of sustainable fintech companies where the growth has exceeded 50%.\\xa0 At the end of 2023, 483 companies were active in the Swiss fintech sector, showing an increase of 11% against the previous year.\\xa0 The Swiss Fintech scene continues its pace of transformation and disruption, setting major trends that may define where the fintech sector will develop and which business models will survive in the long run.\\xa0 While several countries still consider fintech a threat to their economies, allowing poor progress for their fintech business, Switzerland positioned itself already in 2016 with a clear strategy for the stable and steady growth of digitalisation and fintech.\\xa0 Switzerland is accordingly established as a prominent player in fintech offering a secure environment with access to a robust, high-quality technology infrastructure and experienced professionals and service providers with a long tradition in the financial services sector.\\nThe Swiss regulatory approach to fintech continues to stand out amidst global developments.\\xa0 Switzerland’s pragmatic and progressive stance has enabled it to cultivate an ecosystem that simultaneously encourages innovation and safeguards financial stability.\\xa0 In contrast to some jurisdictions that adopted a cautious approach following the banking crisis, Switzerland recognised the transformative potential of fintech and swiftly implemented a regulatory framework conducive to fostering technological advancements.\\xa0 As the SEC moved forward to approve the listing and trading of crypto exchange traded products (ETPs) for the first time early this year, the SIX Swiss Exchange had listed over 200 ETPs with cryptocurrencies as underlying assets, the first dating back to 2016.\\xa0 Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of digital solutions in sustaining financial services, and Switzerland’s forward-thinking regulations provided a solid foundation for its financial sector to adapt and thrive in the face of unprecedented challenges.\\nSwitzerland’s regulatory approach to fintech is centred around fostering an innovation-friendly framework that promotes technological advancements while still upholding the integrity and esteemed reputation of Switzerland as a financial hub.\\xa0 Furthermore, Switzerland’s regulatory environment, characterised by principle-based laws and regulations and technological neutrality, exhibits remarkable adaptability for new technologies and business models.\\nSince 2017, Switzerland has taken proactive measures in adopting regulations to accommodate fintech innovation, such as the regulatory sandbox in banking law, the video and online identification, the fintech licence in 2019 and, in 2021, the introduction of the DLT bill, integrating crypto assets and digital ledger technologies into Swiss civil law and financial market regulations.\\xa0 By incorporating necessary compliance requirements, risk assessment procedures, and anti-money laundering measures, Switzerland endeavours to maintain the reputation, stability and resilience of its financial hub.\\nIn 2023, the following main regulatory developments took place, impacting the fintech sector with different intensity:\\n\\nFINMA issued Staking Guidelines disclosing the regulator’s practice around staking (please see detail below under “Custody services and staking”).\\xa0 The question was triggered due to the transition of the Ethereum blockchain from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm.\\nIn February 2023, FINMA introduced standardised reporting processes for regulated entities that engaged in activities with cryptoassets.\\xa0 Around CHF 6 billion of cryptocurrencies are held in custody in Switzerland.\\xa0 However, regulated entities often rely on a relatively low number of third-party custodians for the custody of cryptocurrencies.\\nIssuance of different regulations and industry association’s recommendations in the field of sustainable finance, with the aim of Switzerland becoming a leading sustainable financial centre.\\xa0 Especially the combination of sustainable financial services and digital technology (green fintech) are seen as a promising opportunity for fintech Swiss market players (see below).\\nEntry into force of the Insurance Supervision Act and the Insurance Supervision Ordinance on January 1, 2024, with an impact also for the Insurtech industry, especially due to more stringent supervision of insurance intermediaries.\\xa0 This particularly impacts companies involved in the provision of online services that advise customers with the conclusion of an insurance contract or that propose insurance contracts.\\xa0 Other amendments under the new insurance regulations are the introduction of a restructuring regime to avoid insolvency and the introduction of relaxed supervisory rules for small insurers, the latter representing an opportunity for Insurtech start-ups.\\nIntroduction of a Limited Qualified Investor Fund (L-QIF) in Switzerland from March 2024, being a Swiss fund exempted from FINMA supervision, but managed by an institution approved by FINMA and limited to qualified investors.\\xa0 This new type of collective investment scheme can be also used in the crypto environment.\\nPreparation of the bill governing the transparency of legal entities which affects all Swiss legal entities and even foreign entities with certain Swiss links.\\nPreparation of the bill on extending international automatic exchange of information in tax matters to cryptoassets in order to implement OECD’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF).\\n\\nFollowing the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MICA) in the EU, Switzerland is assessing the necessity and chances for amending or even redrafting its crypto asset service provider regulations.\\xa0 Furthermore, the existing legal and supervisory framework in the fintech space is currently being reviewed by the government to tackle the question of whether the fintech licence is fulfilling the aim pursued by the corresponding regulations – most likely the fintech licence will be replaced by a new regulatory regime.\\nThe development of Switzerland as an international fintech hub is not only being fuelled by the tech friendly, stable and consistent regulatory framework, but also by the high concentration of companies, investors and organisations that aim to foster the Swiss fintech ecosystem.\\xa0 Amongst such organisations, the House of Insurtech Switzerland, the CryptoValley, Tenity, Swiss Fintech, Swiss Finance + Technology Association (SFTA), Digital Switzerland and many others can be accounted as great accelerators of the Swiss fintech community, bringing shareholders, stakeholders, companies and public players together to foster growth, networking, innovation and success of the use of new technologies in the financial sector.\\nArtificial intelligence was identified by FINMA as a main trend that may impact financial services in the long term.\\xa0 For the time being, no specific regulations have been enacted in connection with the use of artificial intelligence, however, FINMA has warned regulated institutions of the main risks related to this technology, namely the responsibility for AI decisions, the reliability of applications, the transparency and explainability of AI decisions and the equal treatment of financial market clients.\\nFintech offering in Switzerland \\nAccording to the FINMA Annual Report, the core fintech regulatory topics of 2023 were the trading and custody of payment tokens and staking (see detail below under Custody services and staking).\\xa0 On the product side, the segment of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) has grown with intensity.\\xa0 Furthermore, FINMA-supervised institutions in the fintech sector amount to 34 banks and securities firms, which is a sign of maturity of the fintech industry as is being progressively embraced by all market players.\\xa0 Amongst the very varied fintech service offer, embedded finance has been revealed as a major trend with the potential to slowly conquer the market.\\xa0 Solutions may be structured by making use of open finance/open banking, allowing customers to make use of their bank accounts and linking them with different applications offered by fintech companies, but also by linking fintech companies amongst themselves to provide complementary services.\\xa0 The introduction of an e-ID system in Switzerland, planned for 2026 at the earliest, may accelerate the development of embedded finance solutions.\\nPayments\\nDigital payment solutions and mobile banking continue growing steadily in Switzerland.\\xa0 Contactless payments, mobile wallets and peer-to-peer payment applications have gained popularity.\\xa0 Established banks and fintech start-ups offer mobile banking applications with features such as instant payments, money transfers and account management.\\xa0 Powered by SIX and the SNB, the Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) payment system went live with the introduction of instant-payments in November 2023 and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided that the bigger banks must accept incoming instant payments as from August 2024 and the other banks shall follow from the end of 2026.\\xa0 The SNB is actively exploring the potential of wholesale central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) used therefore amongst the SNB and commercial banks, in particular, with projects Helvetia, Jura, Helvetia Phase III, and Mariana.\\xa0 However, according to recent declarations of the SNB chairman, the SNB sees no need for a retail CBDC, mainly due to the impact that this may have on monetary policy.\\nTWINT, a major Swiss mobile payment system, enables seamless in-store, online and person-to-person transactions by mobile phones, eliminating the need for cash or physical cards.\\xa0 TWINT has gained popularity, with over 5 million active users in Switzerland (total population of approx. 8.7 million people) and 590 million transactions in 2023.\\nProgressively, digital payment systems such as payments via QR-Codes or with bitcoin are becoming integrated in the traditional chain of payment service providers.\\nWealth management\\nDigital wealth management has experienced significant growth, driven by advances in technology and regulatory updates from FINMA.\\xa0 In particular, the automation and digitisation of client onboarding and KYC processes has become more widespread, thanks to regulations that allow video and online identification.\\xa0 This has made client onboarding more cost effective.\\xa0 Investment Apps, such as Kaspar& are being well received in the market.\\xa0 In addition, the increasing popularity and availability of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has led to a wider range of algorithmic management offerings.\\xa0 Exchange-traded products (ETPs) opened the possibility for exposures to crypto assets within a traditional financial instrument.\\xa0 Together with the increasing offer of digital assets and online banking solutions, numerous Swiss and foreign banks offer digital investment services.\\xa0 Even if foreign banks are in principle exempted from the banking licence in Switzerland if they do not establish a Swiss physical presence and act on a pure cross-border basis, they are required to implement the FinSA code of conduct when providing digital investment solutions to Swiss customers.\\nTrading bots/robo advisory\\nTrading bots such as UpBots and AlgoTrader have disrupted financial services markets in Switzerland by automating and improving trading processes.\\xa0 UpBots is a Swiss all-in-one platform that enables trading in cryptocurrencies and established commercial markets.\\xa0 AlgoTrader is a Swiss-based algorithmic trading software platform that supports automated trading across multiple asset classes.\\nSophisticated trading signal providers offer their services to financial institutions without requiring a financial market licence, as they provide signals based on general market expectations without accepting deposits from client or managing client portfolios.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\\nAlso in the Swiss financial sector, artificial intelligence is being increasingly relied upon, especially in the fields of risk management, pricing and customer interaction (for example, chatbots).\\xa0 Topics such as accountability, errors, the intransparency for the users and their unequal treatment are the main risks envisaged by FINMA.\\xa0 Based on its competences of supervision of regulated entities, FINMA set out in 2023 its expectations as to the business processes required to manage risks posed by AI by regulated institutions.\\xa0 Since the fourth quarter of 2023, FINMA has been conducting on-site inspections and follow-ups with financial institutions that use AI extensively following a risk-based approach.\\nIn November 2023, the Federal Council ordered the preparation of an overview of possible regulatory approaches to AI, considering the different industries affected as well as the EU AI Act and the Council of Europe’s AI Convention.\\xa0 The report is expected to be published by the end of 2024.\\nAt a legislative level, it is to be highlighted that the Federal Council has initiated in May 2024 the consultation process to extend the automatic exchange of information in tax matters (AEA) to cryptoassets to enter into force in 2026.\\nRegulatory and insurance technology\\nRegulatory technology\\nThe Swiss RegTech (Regulatory Technology) market has seen remarkable developments in recent years as the financial industry seeks innovative solutions to efficiently meet regulatory compliance requirements.\\nSwiss RegTech companies have emerged to provide technology-driven solutions for regulatory compliance. These solutions include automated compliance monitoring, risk assessment, regulatory reporting, and know-your-customer (KYC) processes.\\xa0 Companies such as NetGuardians, Apiax, Alyne, Investglass and Argus Grid Technologies are developing advanced RegTech solutions to help financial institutions navigate the complex regulatory landscape.\\nA key focus area for Swiss RegTech companies is the automation of regulatory reporting processes.\\xa0 By leveraging technologies such as AI and machine learning (ML), these companies offer solutions that streamline data collection, validation, and reporting, enabling financial institutions to meet reporting requirements more efficiently.\\xa0 Companies such as FinCube and JAROWA specialise in the automation of regulatory reporting.\\nSwiss RegTech companies are developing innovative solutions to improve AML compliance and fraud prevention measures.\\xa0 These solutions use advanced analytics, AI and pattern recognition algorithms to detect suspicious activity.\\xa0 Companies such as NetGuardians and KYC Spider are focusing on AML and fraud prevention solutions.\\nIn the aftermath of the Credit Suisse collapse in 2023, FINMA pointed out that as customers lost confidence in the bank, the extensive liquidity outflows were further exacerbated by the digital communication channels (digital bank run) which ultimately brought the bank to the brink of insolvency.\\xa0 Authorities including the regulator had to intervene in an emergency to protect the bank’s creditors and avoid realisation of systemic risks.\\xa0 Experts are of the view that FINMA should have the means to use market information more effectively in its supervision.\\xa0 This may potentially result in the development of further tools in the field of RegTech.\\nInsurance technology\\nWithin Europe, Switzerland is considered an InsurTech hub.\\xa0 Traditional insurers have an advantage when entering the InsurTech market as they already have the necessary licences.\\xa0 Currently, there is no specific legislation for InsurTech business models.\\xa0 Therefore, any regulatory considerations for InsurTech models should be evaluated based on the general regulatory framework for insurance operations.\\nSwitzerland has seen the emergence of several incubators and accelerators focused on fostering InsurTech innovation.\\xa0 According to the IFZ InsurTech Report 2023/2024, Switzerland continues to have a vibrant scene for insurtechs with 66 companies.\\xa0 Recognising the potential of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies in Switzerland are collaborating with startups to improve the customer experience, increase operational efficiency, and explore new business models.\\nAmongst the main trends, the so called “embedded insurance” is worthy of mention as a business model that integrates the insurance in the sale of a main product or service to which it is attached.\\xa0 For example, TONI Digital, which allows businesses to structure insurance to be embedded in their products and services.\\nSome players use AI to identify gaps between insurance policies, such as UpQuai.\\xa0 The development of AI solutions is in full progress at all levels, the insurance multinationals having established specific AI departments to coordinate and even develop AI internal solutions, often combined with the cooperation with tech giants such as Google or Microsoft.\\xa0 Claims handling and underwriting are the fields where most AI solutions are being tested and implemented.\\xa0 An example is the Helvetia-Chatbot using ChatGPT-technology.\\nFurther examples in the field of Insurtech include companies such as Knip, which offers digital insurance management solutions, and Advanon, which focuses on trade credit insurance.\\xa0 Blockchain-based solutions are being explored for areas such as claims management, fraud detection and parametric insurance.\\xa0 An example is Etherisc, which focuses on decentralised insurance applications.\\nInsurTech companies are leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) to enable pay-per-use insurance models.\\xa0 By collecting real-time data from connected devices, such as telematics devices in cars or wearables, insurers can offer personalised insurance products based on individual behaviour and risk profiles.\\xa0 Companies such as GotCourts, a Swiss-based start-up, offer pay-as-you-play insurance for sports activities.\\nRegulatory bodies \\nFINMA is Switzerland’s financial market supervisory authority.\\xa0 FINMA’s primary task is to enforce the laws governing the financial market.\\xa0 Where authorisation is required to engage in financial market activities, FINMA grants such authorisation if the legal requirements are met.\\xa0 It is also responsible for supervising these activities and the Swiss financial market.\\xa0 If necessary, FINMA enforces supervisory law by means of coercive administrative measures.\\xa0 These include precautionary measures or measures to restore compliance with the law, withdrawal of authorisation, liquidation of unauthorised companies, bans on certain industries and activities, and orders to disgorge unlawfully obtained profits.\\xa0 It may also publish final rulings naming the parties involved.\\xa0 FINMA exercises its regulatory powers by issuing ordinances, where provided for in financial market legislation, and circulars on the application of financial market legislation.\\xa0 With regard to anti-money laundering, financial intermediaries must join a private self-regulatory organisation recognised and supervised by FINMA and be subject to its supervision.\\xa0 In addition, portfolio managers are licensed by FINMA but supervised by a private supervisory organisation accredited by FINMA.\\xa0 FINMA is also competent to impose sanctions (e.g. to initiate enforcement proceedings).\\xa0 If an enforcement proceeding gives rise to suspicion of criminal activity, FINMA will file a complaint with the Federal Department of Finance or the Prosecutor’s Office who assess whether to open criminal proceedings or not.\\nFINMA has established a “fintech desk”, which assesses the regulatory qualification of fintech business models that voluntarily request such a pre-assessment from FINMA.\\xa0 Business players use the fintech desk especially when there is a doubt about the interpretation of a specific regulation.\\nKey regulations and regulatory approaches\\nIn general, only banks with a banking licence allowing for the pursuit of the classic interest-difference business model may accept deposits from the public.\\xa0 Therefore, a fintech-oriented company cannot accept deposits from the public unless it first obtains a banking licence.\\xa0 The requirements for such a banking licence are quite onerous, i.e. at least CHF 10 million of fully paid-up equity capital, and the capital, liquidity and organisational requirements are rarely met by start-ups.\\xa0 To create a growth environment for fintech companies, the Swiss legislator first created a sandbox regime and then additionally introduced a fintech licence, which was later extended to cryptocurrencies also.\\xa0 These allow fintech companies to accept deposits from the public without the need for a banking licence.\\xa0 Fintech start-ups can experiment in the market within the sandbox and then grow further with the fintech licence or even a banking licence.\\xa0 Furthermore, the provision of asset and/or fund management services, and the activity as a securities house or securities firm are mainly subject to a license from FINMA.\\xa0 The principle that regulations need to be proportionate can be seen on the rule that supervisory intensity varies depending on the size of the company.\\nFintech licence\\nTo promote innovative financial companies, Switzerland has introduced the FinTech licence.\\xa0 The “FinTech licence” (or “banking licence light”) is a streamlined licence.\\xa0 The FinTech licence allows institutions to accept public deposits of up to CHF 100 million or cryptocurrencies theoretically in an unlimited amount but is subject to the discretion of FINMA, as long as they neither pay interest on nor do proprietary trading/investing with such client funds.\\xa0 The public funds collected by the fintech company must be either kept separate from the company’s own funds or recorded in a manner that allows for separate reporting at any time.\\xa0 The latter option requires the fintech company to undergo a regular audit.\\xa0 Fintech licences are useful for various business models such as crowdlending platforms, trading platforms, payment, account and card services and others.\\xa0 These business models commonly rely on service fees as their revenue source.\\nUnlike fintech companies, full-fledged banks operate under an interest margin business model.\\xa0 They accept public funds without a specific limit, offering lower interest rates (liabilities) while lending to multiple individuals at higher interest rates (assets).\\xa0 This model is inherently risky because the funds collected are typically short term while the loans granted are long term, potentially leading to a bank run.\\xa0 Fintech companies face fewer requirements than full-service banks due to the less risky fee-for-service model they operate under.\\xa0 Fintech companies are exempt from complex capital and liquidity requirements and have reduced accounting and auditing obligations.\\xa0 The minimum capital requirement for fintech companies is 3% of the public deposits collected, with a minimum of CHF 300,000, which is significantly lower than that of full banks.\\xa0 However, fintech companies are obliged to inform clients in writing that their deposits are not covered by the deposit insurance system and to inform them about the risks associated with the company’s business model, services and technologies used.\\nIt is currently subject to review whether the fintech licence has brought the desired effects, and a revision of this licence category is accordingly expected, as mentioned above.\\nSandbox\\nThe unsupervised and unregulated sandbox can be used by companies that accept funds from the public up to CHF 1 million.\\xa0 The sandbox is intended for fintech companies in their initial market testing phase.\\xa0 To be eligible for the sandbox, public deposits may not exceed CHF 1 million in total and no interest rate differential business may be conducted.\\xa0 In addition, depositors must be duly informed before making a deposit that the business is not supervised by FINMA and that the deposit is not covered by the deposit guarantee.\\xa0 If someone acts as a financial intermediary in Switzerland, i.e. as soon as someone holds or manages funds for another person, Swiss anti-money laundering (AML) regulations apply.\\nFinancial markets\\nThe FinIA establishes a legal framework for financial institutions, while the FinSA regulates financial services in Switzerland.\\xa0 FinSA aims to create a level playing field for financial institutions and enhance client protection.\\xa0 It introduces point-of-sale codes of conduct, prospectus requirements and clear key information documents for financial instruments.\\xa0 FinIA standardises rules for financial service providers that manage third-party assets.\\xa0 FinSA’s conduct of business rules are similar to the EU’s MiFID I and II, making it easier for Swiss financial service providers to enter the EU market.\\xa0 Financial service providers must comply with these rules when offering financial instruments in Switzerland.\\xa0 The rules include information and due diligence obligations, suitability tests, documentation requirements and rules of conduct.\\nFintech companies in Switzerland are not subject to specific fee regulations, but they must comply with disclosure requirements regarding fees for financial services.\\xa0 In cases where a Key Information Document (KID) is required for Swiss private clients, a detailed fee disclosure for collective investment schemes and structured products must be included in the KID.\\nDLT trading facilities/DLT\\nThe DLT Bill provided legal certainty in the field of DLT, in particular, for the transfer of DLT-based assets.\\xa0 As a result, market access for fintech companies was improved and regulatory barriers were removed.\\xa0 To this end, ledger-based securities were introduced.\\nA ledger-based security is a right that is registered in a securities ledger in accordance with an agreement between the parties and can only be exercised and transferred to others through that securities ledger.\\xa0 The securities ledger must meet a number of minimum requirements with regard to power of disposal, integrity, publicity and independent access.\\nThe Financial Market Infrastructure Act introduced a new licensing category for “DLT trading facilities”.\\xa0 These function similarly to the existing multilateral trading facilities, but will allow individuals to participate without the involvement of an intermediary.\\xa0 FINMA has not yet issued any licences for DLT trading facilities.\\xa0 According to FINMA, an initial application for licensing as DLT trading facility is in progress.\\nLedger-based securities and intermediated securities\\nThe DLT legislation provides for the issuance and transfer of ledger-based securities by means of a technical transfer on a blockchain or distributed ledger without the physical transfer of a document or paper (required for certificated securities) and/or a written assignment (required for simple uncertificated securities) or an entry by a central securities depository (required for book-entry securities).\\xa0 All previously securitisable rights can also be structured as ledger-based securities, i.e. essentially all contractual rights as well as claims and shares in companies.\\nThe absence of a third party (e.g. a custodian) is the key feature of ledger-based securities.\\xa0 The issuance of ledger-based securities does not require a regulated institution (e.g. a licensed bank, securities firm or central securities depository) to act as a custodian to credit such intermediated securities to specific securities accounts or other depositories.\\nAsset tokens\\nAn asset token represents a property right in an asset.\\xa0 Asset tokens allow both new and existing assets (e.g. stocks, bonds or mutual fund shares) to be traded in the form of security tokens on a digital securities exchange such as the SIX Digital Exchange.\\xa0 Asset tokens can be held with wallet providers that are not prudentially supervised.\\xa0 The category of asset tokens can also include tokens whose purpose is to make physical assets tradable on the blockchain.\\xa0 The spectrum of novel assets facilitates the investment in non-bankable assets such as real estate and art paintings, whereby the legal structure chosen will be decisive for the regulatory qualification.\\xa0 FINMA classifies asset tokens as a claim to ownership of an asset, making them similar to shares or bonds from a regulatory perspective.\\xa0 The qualification of an asset token depends on the features of the structure and rights attached to such asset token, again following technology neutrality.\\nAsset tokens that are offered to the public or placed with more than 20 clients are considered securities under Swiss law.\\xa0 FinSA requires the issuance of a prospectus for asset tokens offered to the public, along with a review by a prospectus review body.\\xa0 Depending on the circumstances, additional regulatory requirements may apply to collective investment schemes and structured products.\\xa0 Intermediaries involved in the placement of securities or derivatives may be subject to securities dealer/firm regulation as an issuing house or derivatives firm.\\nAdditional regulatory requirements apply to the offer of non-Swiss collective investment schemes and structured products or the setting up of a structure of collective investment in Switzerland.\\nThe offer of asset tokens is on the rise, especially in case of actively or passively managed ETFs.\\xa0 Often the ETF itself is issued as an asset token (direct investment in cryptoassets) and the funds are still in traditional form, and often as standard book entry securities listed to track a digital asset such as a cryptocurrency or an index of cryptocurrencies (indirect investments in cryptoassets).\\xa0 Companies like 21Shares, Leontech, Amina Bank and VanEck belong to the standard players in the issuance of tracker certificates and ETFs with cryptoassets as underlying assets.\\nCustody services and staking\\nWith the growing investment in cryptoassets, be it in form of asset tokens (such as securities) or in form of payment tokens or cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin or ether), the regulation regarding the custody of cryptoassets became central.\\xa0 While the general questions regarding the custody of cryptoassets are already sufficiently addressed by Swiss regulations, during 2023, the treatment of staking was particularly questioned.\\xa0 Staking can be defined as the earning of rewards in return for validating the integrity of blockchains in a proof-of-stake validation mechanism, where cryptoassets are provided as collateral by a validator to secure that the validation is made accurately.\\xa0 During the process of staking, cryptoassets can be confiscated (slashing) in case of misbehaviour of a validator or subject to a lock-up or exit period.\\xa0 Staking service providers are often custodians that use cryptoassets of their customers for staking.\\xa0 When custody services are provided, the risk from a regulatory perspective is (besides the slashing and the lock-up period) that the custodian goes bankrupt and assets in custody pass to form part of the bankruptcy estate of the custodian generating a potential loss for customers.\\xa0 As Switzerland regulation is technology neutral, the question of how staked cryptoassets are treated in case of bankruptcy of the custodian needed to be answered by way of interpretation of the already applicable regulatory framework.\\xa0 Therefore, in December 2023, FINMA issued Guidance 8/2023 on staking services.\\xa0 According to Guidance 8/2023, where the cryptocurrencies can be segregated from the bankruptcy estate of the custodian during the staking and custody is individual, no banking licence applies.\\xa0 While this is in principle the case in connection with asset tokens (as it with securities accounts deposited with a bank), in the case of payment tokens, segregation requires under Swiss law that the cryptocurrency is held in readiness for customers at all times and either (i) kept in individual custody, or (ii) kept in collective custody being clearly viewable which part of the cryptoassets belongs to which customer – otherwise no segregation applies and a banking licence is required for the staking service provider.\\nStablecoins\\nIn a supplement to its Guidelines on ICOs, FINMA outlined in 2019 the treatment of stablecoins under Swiss supervisory law.\\xa0 In doing so, FINMA has been following the same approach as for blockchain-based tokens, focusing primarily on the economic function and purpose of a token (substance over form).\\xa0 FINMA adheres to the principle of “same risks, same rules”, taking into account the relevant facts of each case.\\nMany, but not all, stablecoins confer a contractual claim against the issuer to the underlying assets, or confer direct ownership rights, which may make them qualify as asset tokens and potentially, securities.\\xa0 In short, stablecoins can vary widely.\\xa0 As a result, the regulatory requirements also differ depending on the assets the stablecoin is backed by or linked to and the rights of its holders.\\xa0 FINMA therefore distinguishes between asset-backed stablecoins that are linked to cryptocurrencies, commodities, real estate or securities.\\xa0 The specific purpose and characteristics of stablecoins may trigger the application of different financial market laws.\\xa0 Amongst others, regulations on banking, fund management, financial infrastructure, money laundering and securities trading may apply.\\nStablecoin projects often fall within the scope of the licensing requirements of the Banking Act or the Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA).\\xa0 In addition, due to their inherent purpose as a means of payment, most stablecoin projects are also subject to the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA).\\xa0 To the extent that a stablecoin project creates a payment system of significant importance, it may be required to obtain a licence.\\nStablecoin projects using a default guarantee issued by a bank in order to be exempt from a fintech or banking licence have become popular in Switzerland.\\nPayment tokens\\nSo called cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or USDC are, according to the FINMA ICO Guidelines, to be qualified differently from asset tokens to the extent that they do not entail a claim against an issuer as is the case for asset tokens (such as shares, bonds and other financial instruments).\\xa0 By lack of such a claim and accordingly the lack of creation of passive accounts for the issuer, also no public deposits are created and no banking licence applies to the issuer of cryptocurrencies.\\nIn the past years, crypto exchanges have gained importance while Swiss investors hold a relative high amount of cryptoassets.\\xa0 An example is Binance (Switzerland) AG.\\nAML\\nThe AML obligations are imposed on financial intermediaries and dealers.\\xa0 Persons, including legal entities, who hold on deposit assets belonging to others or who assist in the investment or transfer of such assets are considered financial intermediaries under the AML law.\\xa0 More specifically, this includes the execution of credit transactions or the provision of services related to payment transactions, in particular, by carrying out electronic transfers on behalf of others.\\nCompliance with the Swiss AML regulations includes the fulfilment of due diligence requirements, including the identification of beneficial owners, and membership of a self-regulatory organisation or direct supervision by the FINMA.\\nNot only custody-wallet providers or providers safekeeping private keys are subject to Swiss AML-regulations, but also anyone facilitating the transfer of virtual currencies provided that it enters into an ongoing business relationship.\\nThe Swiss AMLA states that not only banks and securities dealers, but also any person who provides payment services or issues or administers a payment instrument is a financial intermediary subject to the act.\\nPayments\\nIn contrast to the European Union (EU) with its payment services directive II and e-money directive with respective licence regimes, Switzerland has no payment-specific regulatory framework.\\xa0 Payment activities are usually either lightly regulated by being only subject to Swiss AML-regulations or rather strict regulated by being subject to Swiss AML- and banking regulations.\\xa0 The fintech licence created a kind of middle ground to this pretty big regulatory balancing act.\\nDAO\\nA DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organisation that operates through smart contracts on a blockchain.\\xa0 It is designed to be autonomous, meaning that it operates without a centralised authority or hierarchical structure.\\xa0 Instead, decision-making within a DAO is typically governed by voting mechanisms and predefined rules encoded in smart contracts.\\nAlthough the DAO is not a fixed term in Swiss law and does not have a defined structure, its effects may well be recognised therein.\\xa0 In some cases, a DAO qualifies as a collective investment scheme, in particular, if an asset is collected from multiple users to finance the DAO and its activities.\\xa0 However, a DAO would at least qualify as a simple partnership under the CO, as it is a catch-all arrangement leading to unlimited liability of its members and tax consequences.\\nThe legal form of the Swiss association provides a suitable legal wrapper for the DAO, limiting the personal liability of its members.\\xa0 The Swiss association is a very flexible legal form with few mandatory laws, allowing it to be tailored to the specific needs of a project.\\xa0 In addition, liability is limited to the association’s assets, and the association has full legal personality and can therefore enter into contracts.\\nAs of January 1, 2023, new regulations came into force for associations that are required to be registered in the Commercial Register.\\nSustainable finance \\nAlso in Switzerland, the financial services regulation is moving towards the implementation of ESG standards.\\xa0 FINMA Guidance 5/2021 sets out the current practice on the prevention of greenwashing in connection with collective investment schemes.\\xa0 In December 2023, the Federal Council updated the Swiss Climate Scores which are considered as best practice recommendations to achieve climate transparency and are addressed to investment institutions such as asset managers, banks and insurance companies.\\xa0 From\\xa0 January 1, 2024, public companies and regulated entities with a certain size are required to publish a report following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.\\xa0 The Swiss Asset Management Association AMAS updated its principle based self-regulation for members in 2023, covering transparency and disclosure for sustainability-related collective assets and, to align with the objectives of the Federal Council, AMAS has issued self-regulation 2.0 to become effective in September 2, 2024.\\xa0 In February 2024, FINMA launched a consultation on a new circular covering the supervisory practice regarding the management of nature-related financial risks for banks and insurers.\\xa0 It is expected that further regulations will enter into force in 2026 providing a common understanding regarding the designation of financial products and financial services as sustainable.\\nImplications of new EU law\\nOn May 16, 2023, the European Council adopted the European Union Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), which came into force on June 30, 2023 and must be applied partly from June 30, 2024 and the rest from December 30, 2024.\\xa0 Despite being a non-EU country, Switzerland will be affected by MiCA as most crypto-related businesses have links to EU jurisdictions.\\xa0 Therefore, Swiss companies that offer their products or services to EU countries will need to carefully assess whether their business activities are subject to MiCA or, with respect to crypto-assets that constitute financial instruments such as securities, to the EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).\\xa0 As MiCA aims to cover the range of crypto-assets as broadly as possible, it is likely to have an impact even if it falls outside the scope of Swiss financial market regulation.\\nSome tokens are subject to extended rules under MiCA.\\xa0 For example, stablecoins are considered an “e-money token” or an “asset-reference token” under MiCA.\\xa0 The issuance of an e-money token or asset-referenced token generally requires a physical presence within the EU/EEA and a licence.\\xa0 In addition, a so-called “crypto-asset whitepaper” must be published.\\nOn July 12, 2024, the AI Act was published, and will apply to private and public actors inside and outside the EU starting on August 1, 2024, to the extent that the AI system is localised in the EU or its use affects persons in the EU.\\xa0 Accordingly, AI systems localised in Switzerland may be caught by the EU AI Act.\\xa0 Accordingly, it is sensible to consider relevant compliance with the AI Act when designing projects, taking also the relevant sanctions into account.\\xa0 The AI Act has taken a risk-based approach with four levels with may be used as a risk management tool.\\nRestrictions \\nThe Federal Council has actively worked to remove market entry barriers for fintech companies.\\xa0 This approach has been underscored by the introduction of a new category of fintech licences in the Swiss Banking Act and its ordinance.\\xa0 By simplifying the requirements for a special licence for fintech companies, market entry barriers are lowered.\\xa0 Previously, such activities would have required a full banking licence, a deal-breaker for most fintech companies as they generally remain outside core banking activities despite providing bank-like services.\\xa0 There is also a growing focus on open banking.\\nCross-border business \\nWith the introduction of FINSA and the Swiss FinIA, foreign financial service providers wishing to target clients domiciled in Switzerland with financial instruments are required to register.\\xa0 The obligation to register is imposed on the persons who act as “client advisors” for the financial service provider, not on the provider itself.\\xa0 However, client advisors of prudentially supervised foreign financial institutions are not required to register if services are exclusively provided to per se professional clients.\\xa0 An exception to register may apply under certain circumstances according to the newly adopted Bern Financial Services Agreement between Switzerland and the United Kingdom, adopted in December 2023.\\n\\nEditor’s Note\\nThis chapter has been written by a member of GLI’s international panel of experts, who has been exclusively appointed for this task as a leading

fintech industry, which witnessed high-profile developments and promising growth in niche areas, but also significant challenges.\\nCorporate bankruptcies soared to record levels, impacting the fintech sector. Meanwhile, funding for fintech startups continued its downward trajectory as investors increasingly prioritized biotech, as well as energy and cleantech.\\nDespite these setbacks, Switzerland’s fintech sector showed resilience and innovation. Key milestones included notable acquisitions, progressive regulatory measures covering artificial intelligence (AI) and digital assets, as well as government-backed initiatives including the rollout of instant payments and the inaugural SwissHacks event.\\nCorporate bankruptcies reach new record\\nIn 2024 Switzerland witnessed a sharp rise in corporate bankruptcies, setting a new record. According to Swissinfo.ch, bankruptcies increased by 15% to 11,506 cases, driven by a notable 18% surge in insolvencies due to over-indebtedness. Organizational deficiencies also accounted for a 6.6% rise in bankruptcy publications.\\nThe fintech sector also faced challenges. In particular, FlowBank, a Geneva-based online brokerage and trading bank, was declared bankrupt by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in June.\\nThis measure became necessary as FlowBank no longer had the minimum capital required for its business operations, and faced issues related to incomplete financial reporting. There was also fears that the bank was over-indebted.\\nFlowBank was a bank offering online brokerage and trading with its head office in Geneva and subsidiaries in London and the Bahamas. The bank had total assets of approximately CHF 680 million at the time of the announcement, over 22,000 client accounts and around 140 staff worldwide.\\nFlowBank launched in 2020, offering banking and trading services. It was the banking partner for Techteryx, the stablecoin issuer behind TrueUSD (TUSD). The company was part-owned by crypto asset management firm CoinShares and reportedly offered banking services to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.\\nDeclining fintech funding\\n2024 saw fintech funding drop significantly. In H1 2024, investments in fintech startups in Switzerland fell by 58.5% year-on-year (YoY), plummeting from CHF 191 million in H1 2023 to CHF 79.2 million in H2 2024, according to the new Swiss Venture Capital report. The number of financing rounds also saw a significant drop, declining from 30 in H1 2023 to just 13 in H1 2024, marking a 56.7% decrease.\\nInvestment in Swiss startups in first half of year, Source: Swiss Venture Capital Report 2024 | Update, Startupticker.ch, SECA and startup.ch, Jul 2024\\nThis downturn reflects a broader shift in investor priorities, with growing attention directed toward sectors such as biotech, as well as energy and cleantech. In H1 2024, biotech startups generated CHF 405.3 million, the third highest amount ever. This is a significant improvement compared to H1 2023, during which biotech startups secured CHF 282.8 million through 14 deals. Energy and cleantech startups also attracted increased investments, securing CHF 160 million across 27 rounds in H1 2024, up from CHF 137 million and 19 deals in H1 2023.\\nSignificant fintech acquisitions\\n2024 also recorded a number of notable acquisitions in the Swiss fintech landscape:\\n\\nNetGuardians, a specialist in AI-driven fraud prevention and anti-money laundering (AML) solutions, was acquired in September by Stockholm-based private equity firm Summa Equity. Recognized for its pioneering approach, underpinned by its proprietary 3D AI technology, NetGuardians serves over 80 banks and wealth managers worldwide, including Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB), Lombard Odier, Swissquote, and the United Overseas Bank (UOB).\\nMidFunder, a Zurich-based fintech company providing financing to companies with recurring revenue, was acquired in March by Levenue, Europe’s largest revenue-based financing company. The acquisition aims to accelerate Levenue’s growth in Switzerland.\\nMoneyland.ch, a popular comparison platform in Switzerland, was acquired in July by SMG Swiss Marketplace Group, a firm which operates network of online marketplaces. The acquisition aims to strengthen SMG Swiss Marketplace Group’s finance and insurance division and allow it to gain valuable comparison services for consumers.\\n\\nControversies and regulatory actions\\nIn 2024, two significant developments unfolded in the Swiss fintech industry, underscoring the challenges faced by some of its leading players.\\nThe first event involved Temenos, a global leader in banking software based in Geneva. In February, the company was accused of “accounting irregularities” by the short-seller Hindenburg Research. These allegations, including claims of earnings manipulation through contract backdating and the funding of software purchases through undisclosed investments, sparked widespread attention and affected the business, delaying deal signings and dampening revenue growth, the company said.\\nThe Swiss provider of banking software reported second-quarter sales of US$248.4 million, missing the US$255.1 million average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. It slashed its 15% target for sales growth for 2024 by two percentage points.\\nTemenos conducted a probe which concluded the short seller’s findings were “inaccurate and misleading” in April. It also appointed new CEO Jean-Pierre Brulard after pressure from activist shareholders.\\nTemenos is a global financial software company specializing in core banking solutions to financial institutions, including retail, corporate, business, and wealth management banks. It has a diverse and impressive client base, including some of the world’s largest and most well-known financial institutions such as ABN AMRO, Societe Generale, Nordea Bank and Alrajhi Bank.\\nThe second key development involved Leonteq, a Zurich-based derivatives specialist. The company faced regulatory action from FINMA for having violated its risk management obligations related to the distribution of financial market products by foreign distributors, Swissinfo.ch reported in December. As a result, the financial regulator ordered the firm to hand over CHF 9.3 million in profits.\\nThe investigation also revealed that Leonteq had worked “in some cases with dubious, unregulated distributors”.\\nProminent fintech trade groups merge\\nDecember saw the merger of the Swiss Fintech Association (SFA) and the Swiss Finance +\\xa0 Technology Association (SFTA), two prominent fintech trade groups in Switzerland.\\nThe unified entity, named the Swiss Fintech Association (SFTA), said it will focus on enhancing advocacy, expanding its networks, and supporting the growth of the Swiss fintech ecosystem. Key initiatives will include continuing to develop the Fintech Fair, regular decentralized meetups, as well as stronger collaboration with regulators and policy makers.\\nGovernment and regulatory initiatives\\nIn 2024, the Swiss government continued its commitment to fintech development through several key initiatives.\\nIn July, FINMA published new guidance on the issuance of stablecoins, emphasizing the financial market laws that apply to projects aiming to issue stablecoins, including AML regulations and minimum requirements for default guarantees.\\nSwiss Financial Regulator Issues Stablecoin Guidelines, Emphasizing AML Obligations and Default Guarantee Requirements, Fintech News Switzerland\\nIn December, the regulator released additional guidance on governance and risk management when using AI, focusing on operational risks, data-related risks, IT and cyber risks, increased third-party dependencies as well as legal and reputational risks.\\nIn August, instant payments went live in Switzerland, allowing private individuals and companies to perform account-to-account transactions with immediate execution and final settlement in seconds – 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (including public holidays). Around 60 financial institutions had the capability activated at launch, covering more than 95% of Swiss retail payment transactions. The Swiss National Bank (SNB), in collaboration with SIX Group, spearheaded the initiative.\\nFinally, June marked the inaugural SwissHacks event, a government-sponsored hackathon dedicated to financial innovation. Organized by the Swiss Financial Innovation Desk (FIND), an independent unit within the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF), this event aimed to bring together talent and foster innovative solutions for Switzerland’s financial ecosystem.\\nA booming sustainable fintech sector\\nE.foresight, a Swiss banking think tank operated by telecommunications provider Swisscom, released in June its Swiss Sustainable Fintech Map, highlighting the fintech companies in Switzerland that incorporate sustainability into their core business models, operations, and products.\\n\\nThe map revealed that Switzerland was home to 49 companies that fall under the sustainable fintech category at the time, providing the segment a share of 12% of the overall fintech ecosystem.\\nThe figure implies that the Swiss sustainable fintech sector rose by 53% between 2023 and 2024, growing at a much faster pace than the fintech sector as a whole (16%) during the period, data from the 2024 IFZ Fintech Study by the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts’ Institute of Financial Services Zug (IFZ) show.\\nSwitzerland is recognized as the fourth market globally for sustainable fintech. This thriving space has risen on the back of supportive initiatives and promotion efforts by the government through initiatives such as the establishment of the Green Fintech Network, the release of the Green Fintech Action Plan, and the launch of a new system that measures the environmental impact of financial investments.\\nSwiss retail banks unfazed by fintech competition\\nSwitzerland has seen a sharp increase in fintech companies, which grew from fewer than 200 players in 2016 to nearly 500 in 2023.\\nDespite this growth, Swiss retail banks remain optimistic about their competitive position, confident in their ability to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver high-quality advice, even in the face of new entrants.\\nA study by auditing and consulting firm EY, in collaboration with the University of St. Gallen, reveals that these advantages, which include capital strength, brand trust, a diverse product offering and long-established customer relationships, position incumbents well against fintech companies and neobanks.\\nThese players are facing hurdles such as limited customer bases and challenges in scaling their operations, which have so far constrained their market penetration.\\nSwiss financial institutions double down on digital assets\\nIn 2024, Swiss financial institutions ramped up blockchain and crypto initiatives. According to a study by the University of St. Gallen, in collaboration with vision& and mintminds, more than 80% of Swiss banks are either planning to develop and actively expanding their blockchain offerings, with a particular focus on cryptocurrencies (+60%)\\nMeanwhile, the Swiss stock exchange is exploring the creation of a venue in Europe for trading cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported in September. SIX Group, which is owned by 120 banks, runs a crypto derivatives company called AsiaNext out of Singapore, in a joint venture with Japan’s SBI Group. It also operates a separate digital exchange in Switzerland, where nine digital bonds have been listed since 2018 by issuers such as investment bank UBS and the city of Lugano local authority.\\n\\xa0\\nFeatured image credit: edited from freepik\\n\\n\\n2024 in review fintech in Switzerland\\n\\n\\nShare.\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\nTelegram\\n\\n\\nCopy Link\\n \\n\\nEmail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAuthor \\n\\nFintechnews Switzerland\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nX (Twitter)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nN26 Co-Founder Valentin Stalf to Step Down as CEO and Join Supervisory BoardAugust 21, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 Swiss Fintech Startups Selected for 2025 Venture Leaders London RoadshowAugust 13, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClearBank Appoints David Samper as Group CFOAugust 4, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRevolut to Become Title Partner of Audi F1 Team from 2026July 30, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBerner Kantonalbank Appoints Markus Schwab to Lead New IT and Innovation DepartmentJuly 29, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArsenal Partners with Airwallex as Official Finance Software ProviderJuly 21, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSlovenia to Introduce New Digital Nomad Visa in November 2025July 10, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWEF and Cambridge Fintech Report: The Future of Global FintechJuly 10, 2025\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFintech Newsletter\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to the most important Fintech Switzerland News \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatured Fintech Event \\n\\nTop Swiss Fintech Startups \\n\\nFollow Us \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX / Twitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstagram\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUpcoming Fintech Events\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIC Instant Payments: One year on, one year to go for Phase 2\\nAugust 28, 2025\\nSwitzerland\\nOnline \\n\\n\\nFinance Summit - The Future of Finance\\nSeptember 3, 2025-September 4, 2025\\nGermany-Dusseldorf\\n \\n\\n\\nPropTech Connect 2025\\nSeptember 3, 2025-September 4, 2025\\nUnited Kingdom-London\\n \\n\\n\\n5th Annual FinCrime Leaders Summit DACH\\nSeptember 4, 2025\\nGermany-Frankfurt\\n \\n\\n\\nDigital Treasury Summit 2025\\nSeptember 8, 2025\\nSwitzerland-Zurich\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nView More\\n\\n\\r\\nPromote EventFintech JobsAccount ManagerZug, Part Time (50% utilization)Crypto Valley AssociationViewLead Digitalisierung Kredite & Hypotheken80-100%, HybridPragmatica AGView(Senior) Consultant (m/w/d)Zurich, Full-time, HybridQPLIXViewFX Sales AssociateZurich, Full-time, On-siteEburyViewGeschäftsführer:in (CEO) (m/w/d)Thun, Full-time, PayrexxView\\n\\n\\r\\nView MoreAdd Vacancy American Newsletter \\n\\nSINGAPORE FINTECH REPORT 2024 \\n\\nUAE Fintech Report 2024 \\n\\nPartner Content\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndtcpay Makes European Play With Preliminary Nod From Luxembourg Regulator\\nJuly 29, 2025\\n\\nRead\\n\\n\\nFinancial Institutions Prioritise Cloud for AI and Operational Resilience\\nJuly 15, 2025\\n\\nRead\\n\\n\\nCurve Deepens Partnership with Thales to Enhance Mobile Payments\\nJuly 4, 2025\\n\\nRead\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNavigationAbout Fintech News Network\\nFNN Media Kit\\nWork With Us\\nContact Us\\nFintech Switzerland Newsletter\\nSubmit Vacancy\\nSubmit Press Release\\nSubmit Fintech Startup\\nDatenschutzerklärung / Impressum\\nOther Fintech News Network Publications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet Informed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSubscribe to Updates\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nSubscribe to the most important Fintech Switzerland News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAgree to our terms and policy agreement.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Facebook\\n\\n\\n LinkedIn\\n\\n\\n X (Twitter)\\n\\n\\n Instagram\\n\\n\\n RSS\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Fintech News Network\\nFNN Media Kit\\nWork With Us\\nContact Us\\nFintech Switzerland Newsletter\\nSubmit Vacancy\\nSubmit Press Release\\nSubmit Fintech Startup\\nDatenschutzerklärung / Impressum\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t© 2015 - 2025 Copyright CK Finanzpro GmbH.

It actively addresses new developments in the financial market and assesses innovative business models in a risk-based and technology-neutral manner. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swiss financial centre has maintained a high level of innovation activity. In 2024, FINMA continued to respond swiftly and competently to enquiries from supervised institutions about innovative expansions to their business models and from new players wishing to enter the market.Two applications submitted for DLT trading facilitiesThe Federal Act on the Adaptation of Federal Law to Developments in Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT Act) entered into force in 2021. In 2024, FINMA processed two licence applications for DLT trading facilities.FINMA took this opportunity to clarify some important underlying issues. It stipulated that issuers also have typical issuer obligations for their DLT securities registered on DLT trading facilities. These include the duties of ad hoc publicity and the disclosure of management transactions. In addition, the regulation requires operators that have their settlement infrastructure on a public blockchain to take measures to contain operational risks. These include technical audits of the technology used such as the public blockchain itself and the source codes of smart contracts. These code audits help to detect security gaps or errors. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts that are stored on a blockchain and automatically executed under certain conditions.The question of finality, i.e. when a disposal of DLT securities is legally effective, needs clarifying for DLT based settlement systems. It must take account of the technical peculiarity of entries in the blockchain never being one hundred percent final (legal finality vs. probabilistic finality of the blockchain). Here, FINMA requires operators of a DLT trading facility to issue clear, transparent and binding rules for participants. They must state clearly when the transfer of ownership becomes legally final. FINMA likewise attaches importance to an effective strategy with regard to business continuity management (BCM). Furthermore, precautions must be taken for the possible failure of a component of the DLT infrastructure. For a DLT-based settlement infrastructure, FINMA requires measures and rules setting out how to deal with the securities admitted to trading in the event of a dysfunctional network (e.g. declaration as invalid, reissue, alternative trading options, etc.). Both the participants and issuers must be included in the process here.Finally, FINMA declared that foreign participants do not require any separate authorisation (remote member authorisation). However, a DLT trading facility must ensure that foreign non-private participants are adequately supervised and subject to equivalent regulatory obligations as Swiss participants.Intensive supervision of institutions in the FinTech sector in accordance with Article 1b of the Banking ActThe supervision of institutions with FinTech licences in accordance with Article 1b of the BA, known as 1b institutions, also proved challenging in the year under review. The focus here was on protecting depositors due to the tight capital and liquidity situation of the institutions. These institutions are generally start-ups that, as expected, have major expenses for establishing themselves and entering the market, and initially have no or little income. Successful market entry depends on successful funding rounds and a viable business model. The business models lie in the payment services sector, where the market is competitive and the margins are small. It has been shown that business models that address a niche with a unique offering or specialised client segment can be successful.FINMA required FinTech institutions to conduct ongoing capital and liquidity planning and be capable of identifying bottlenecks in good time. Nevertheless, some risky situations arose at several institutions in the year under review. The situation was frequently exacerbated due to the questionable intrinsic value assets in gone concern scenarios when companies had difficulties continuing their business activities and were forced to consider liquidation. This particularly affected the valuation of in-house software that in many cases constitutes a major asset and cannot be disposed of easily, especially under time pressure.Expectations regarding stablecoin projects formulatedFINMA already published guidelines concerning a possible licensing requirement for issuers of stablecoins back in 2019 as a supplement to its guidelines on initial coin offerings. Furthermore, it stated in its 2021 Annual Report that according to the Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) stablecoin issuers had to ensure that the identity of all holders of stablecoins was adequately verified by the issuer itself or by appropriately supervised financial intermediaries. Just as anonymous accounts are prohibited, so too are anonymous stablecoins.FINMA consolidated the financial market requirements in the year under review by publishing Guidance 06/2024\\xa0and in particular drew the attention of the banks involved to the relevant risks. Stablecoins aim to represent an asset with low price volatility on a blockchain, which is generally done by pegging it to a national currency. In order to achieve this, holders of stablecoins normally have a redemption claim at any time towards the issuer. For this reason, these claims usually qualify as deposits under banking law. FINMA also underlined in its aforementioned guidance the growing money laundering, terrorist financing and sanction circumvention risks arising from the possibility of anonymous transfers of stablecoins.FINMA also noted that various stablecoin issuers in Switzerland make use of default guarantees from banks, and therefore do not themselves require a licence under banking law. FINMA set out its minimum requirements concerning such default guarantees for the protection of stablecoin holders, and pointed to the remaining risks for clients and to operational, legal and reputational risks for the guaranteeing banks.Within the framework of the ongoing regulatory project under the direction of the FDF and the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF), FINMA called for the risks set out in the guidance to be adequately addressed.Implementation of supervisory expectations in connection with stakingFINMA explained its practice with regard to staking services in Guidance 08/2023. Staking allows holders of certain cryptocurrencies to have these blocked in order to support the security and operation of a blockchain network. They receive a reward in return, often in the form of additional coins. During its onsite supervisory reviews in the year under review, FINMA found that clients were being made more aware of the risks and legal uncertainties associated with staking. However, in a number of cases their attention was not drawn sufficiently to the counterparty risk due to the legal uncertainty if a staking service provider were to fail. Furthermore, there was a routine lack of information about the specific risks of the individual blockchain technology.Individual institutions also had gaps in the due diligence audit of the validator node operators involved and in the development of contingency scenarios if such a third-party provider were to fail. Finally, FINMA urged the institutions to supplement and regularly update their Digital Assets Resolution Package (DARP). The DARP serves the liquidator as a source of information in the event of bankruptcy for accessing the cryptoassets and correctly assigning and paying them out to the individual clients.Another issue besides staking was the implementation of the requirements for foreign custodians. The financial institutions are required to ensure that custodians do not conduct their business activity without authorisation, that they are prudentially supervised abroad and that they operate in a jurisdiction that guarantees the same legal certainty as Switzerland regarding the treatment under bankruptcy law of cryptoassets held in custody.(From the Annual Report 2024) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAnnual Report 2024                    \\n\\n\\nUpdated: 08.04.2025\\nSize: 2.35\\xa0 MB\\n\\nLanguage(s):\\n\\nDE\\n\\n\\nFR\\n\\n\\nIT\\n\\n\\nEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd to personal download list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEntwicklung der Digitalisierung im Finanzbereich   2024\\n\\nLegal basis for FINMA’s activities\\nLegal basis\\n\\n\\nCirculars\\n\\n\\nConsultations and evaluations\\n\\n\\nFINMA position statements\\nFINMA Guidance\\n\\n\\nFINMA publications\\n\\n\\nFINMA videos\\nDossiers\\n\\n\"Too big to fail\" dossier\\n\\n\\nDossier on small insurers\\n\\n\\nDossier on portfolio managers and trustees\\n\\n\\nDossier on Sustainable Finance\\n\\n\\nDossier on the mortgage market\\n\\n\\nFinTech dossier\\n\\nAt a glance: list of crypto services\\nDevelopment of digitalisation in the financial sector (2024)\\nEfficient processing of FinTech authorisation enquiries\\nDigitalisation in the financial sector\\nArtificial intelligence: FINMA sets out its supervisory expectations\\nArtificial intelligence in the Swiss financial market (2023)\\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) 2022\\nInnovation 2021\\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\\nArtificial intelligence in the Swiss financial market\\nInnovation 2020\\nFinTech: progress and status report 2020\\nInnovation and supervision 2019\\nDevelopments in FinTech\\nFinancial technology and digitalisation (2017)\\nFinancial technology and digitalisation (2016)\\nFinancial technology and digitalisation (2015)\\n\\nDossier on cyber risks\\n\\n\\nDossier on money laundering prevention\\n\\n\\nDossier on small banks\\n\\n\\n\\nEnforcement reporting\\n\\n\\nInsurance law rulings\\nSelf-regulation\\n\\n\\nSanctions and FATF statements\\n\\n\\nArchive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSwiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA\\n\\n\\n\\nLaupenstrasse 27,\\r\\n                        3003\\nBern\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhone +41 31 327 91 00,\\r\\n                        Fax +41 31 327 91 01\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninfo@finma.ch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch site\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAuthorisation\\n\\nAuthorisation\\nTypes of authorisation\\nBanks and securities firms\\nInsurers\\nInsurance intermediaries\\nAsset management\\nPortfolio managers and trustees\\nSupervisory organisations\\nRepresentative offices of financial institutions based outside Switzerland under FinIA\\nSelf-regulatory organisations (SROs)\\nFinancial market infrastructures and foreign market participants\\nRating agencies\\nRegistration body\\nOmbudsmen for financial service providers\\nReviewing body for prospectuses\\nFinTech\\n\\n\\n\\nSupervision\\n\\nOur approach to supervision\\nCross-sector issues\\nBanks and securities firms\\nInsurers\\nInsurance intermediaries\\nAsset Management\\nPortfolio managers and trustees\\nSupervisory organisations\\nSelf-regulatory organisations (SROs)\\nFinancial market infrastructures\\nCentral mortgage bond institutions\\nFinTech\\n\\n\\n\\nEnforcement\\n\\nAll about Enforcement\\nLicence holders\\nUnauthorised activities\\nMarket supervision\\nEnforcement tools\\nDatabase for assessing fitness and propriety requirements\\nNational and international cooperation\\nRights and obligations\\nCase reports and court decisions\\nRecovery and resolution\\n\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n\\nLegal basis for FINMA’s activities\\nLegal basis\\nCirculars\\nConsultations and evaluations\\nFINMA position statements\\nFINMA Guidance\\nFINMA publications\\nFINMA videos\\nDossiers\\nEnforcement reporting\\nInsurance law rulings\\nSelf-regulation\\nSanctions and FATF statements\\nArchive\\n\\n\\n\\nFINMA\\n\\nFINMA – an overview \\nSupervisory objectives\\nOrganisation\\nWorking at FINMA\\nActivities\\nAuditing\\nFINMA mandataries\\nNational cooperation\\nInternational activities\\nDigital exchange\\nMaking a report\\n\\n\\nFINMA Public\\n\\n\\nArticle series: FINMA at work\\nAuthorised companies\\nWarnings\\nReporting information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEN\\nDE\\nFR\\nIT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2025 FINMA\\n\\nMedia\\n\\n\\nJobs and careers\\n\\n\\nContact\\n\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\n\\nTerms and conditions\\n\\n\\nAbout this website\\n\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\n\\nArchive\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n©\\xa02025\\xa0FINMA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</Document>\\n\\n<Document name=\" Fintech 2025 -

Fintech Market\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 1.1 Evolution of the Fintech Market\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nMarket conditions for fintech offerings in Switzerland are generally considered favourable. This is due to:broad access to credit and venture capital;an educated workforce (a high number of graduates in science and technology); andwidespread access to and use of information and communication technology.Switzerland’s fintech market has experienced significant growth and expansion, with both the value chain and the product and service range seeing acceleration from an already high level. According to the Swiss Venture Capital Report 2024, total investment in the fintech industry decreased substantially to CHF424 million, in essence a reduction by half, which is also a sharper decline than in the overall market. While the investment decline is significant, it has to be considered that investments in the fintech sector in the ten years prior grew rapidly, and current numbers are still way above pre-pandemic numbers. Of note is that the number of funding rounds increased to 60, a new all-time high.Swiss legislation has recently focused on adapting the legal and regulatory framework to the needs of the fintech sector (see 2.4 Variations Between the Regulation of Fintech and Legacy Players), contributing to a more dynamic Swiss fintech sector. For example, specific legislation in the area of blockchain came into force in the course of 2021, which ensures that Switzerland remains an attractive place for fintech startups (see 10.2 Local Regulators’ Approach to Blockchain). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        2. Fintech Business Models and Regulation in General\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 2.1 Predominant Business Models\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swiss fintech landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, and Switzerland remains an attractive location for financial sector innovators. There are currently over 500 active players in Switzerland’s fintech ecosystem, including both emerging and established companies. The total number of fintech-related businesses is much higher. These companies primarily focus on the financial market sector, notably:payment services;investment management;banking infrastructure;deposits and lending;distributed ledger technology (DLT); andanalytics.Many of these businesses offer their products and services to established financial institutions and/or collaborate on digitisation projects. Switzerland’s fintech market is primarily composed of start-ups that receive most of their funding through venture capital. In Switzerland, it is common for established financial service providers to work with emerging fintech companies. The value chain of established financial service providers is being scrutinised and challenged both internally and externally. Emerging fintech companies are developing new technology-driven products and services that have the potential to disrupt the value chain of established players. Established financial service providers generally have the necessary financial and organisational resources to gradually adapt their business processes, both to avoid this displacement and achieve high market visibility. Conversely, a relatively small number of emerging companies can rely on a trusted brand or a financial market licence (eg, a bank). In 2019, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) granted banking licences to fintech players for the first time, namely AMINA Bank AG (formerly Seba AG) and Sygnum, which specialise in assets based on DLT. Other notable fintech players have since received FINMA licences for nearly all types of traditional licences – eg, Revolut Bank UAB (Swiss authorised representative of a foreign bank), Taurus SA (securities firm), VIAC Invest AG (fund manager), Alphemy Capital SA (manager of collective assets) and SDX Trading AG (stock exchange). \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.2 Regulatory Regime\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nSwiss law takes a technology-neutral and principle-based approach, which has significant implications for fintech companies operating in Switzerland. Unlike other jurisdictions, Swiss-based fintech companies benefit from a more flexible regulatory environment that allows for greater regulatory latitude. FINMA has made regulatory changes to support fintech development and lower market entry barriers. These changes are risk-based and technology-neutral. Recent legislative projects, including two new regulatory licence types – the so-called fintech licence, also referred to as a “banking licence light” – have created a technology-neutral regulatory framework for accepting deposits of up to CHF100 million from the public without engaging in typical commercial banking activities (see 2.5 Regulatory Sandbox), and the DLT trading facility has created a regulatory framework for a trading venue specific to DLT-based securities.Alongside these specific measures, fintech companies are also subject to the general legal and regulatory framework summarised in the following (see 2.10 Significant Enforcement Actions).Banking LegislationIn Switzerland, soliciting and accepting deposits from the public on a professional basis is a restricted activity that requires a full-fledged banking licence from FINMA. The term “deposit” is broadly defined under the Banking Act as any undertaking for own account to repay a certain amount. Deposits are considered “public” when:funds are solicited from the public (as opposed to being solicited from banks or professional financial intermediaries, institutional investors, shareholders, employees or other related persons); andfunds from more than 20 depositors are accepted.As a result, many business models used, for instance, by payment systems, payment services providers and crowdfunding or crowdlending platforms are considered to involve the solicitation and acceptance of deposits and may fall within the scope of the Banking Act, therefore triggering licensing requirements.However, fintech companies do not need a banking licence to hold deposits under CHF1 million (see 2.5 Regulatory Sandbox). Similarly, no banking licence is needed if deposits (regardless of amount) are held for less than 60 days on a settlement account. All other deposit-taking activities require either a fintech licence for deposit-taking not exceeding CHF100 million or a full-fledged banking licence. It is also worth noting that funds linked to means of payment, or to a payment system, do not qualify as deposits, provided that:the funds serve the purpose of purchasing goods or services;no interest is paid on them; andthe funds remain below a threshold of CHF3,000 per customer.This exemption may benefit some card payment services and online or mobile payment services. However, they need to ensure that funds stored on user accounts are only for buying goods and services (not for peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers, withdrawals, transfers to a user’s bank account, etc) and never exceed CHF3,000 per customer.Anti-Money Laundering LegislationThe Federal Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) defines an intermediary as any natural or legal person who accepts or holds deposit assets belonging to others, or assists in the investment or transfer of such assets. This covers everyone who carries out credit transactions (such as consumer loans or mortgages, factoring, commercial financing or financial leasing) or who provides payment transaction services. This affects many emerging business models, such as mobile payment, blockchain and related applications, cryptocurrencies, automated investment advice, crowdfunding and P2P lending. Under this broad scope, many – if not most – fintech companies qualify as financial intermediaries and are generally subject to anti-money laundering (AML) obligations, including compliance with know your customer (KYC) rules (see 2.14 Impact of AML and Sanctions Rules).Swiss Financial Services Act, Swiss Financial Institutions ActThe Swiss Financial Services Act (FinSA) and Swiss Financial Institutions Act (FinIA) came into force on 1 January 2020. While the purpose of FinIA is to provide a new legal framework governing most financial institutions (ie, asset managers, trustees, managers of collective assets, fund managers and securities firms), FinSA is designed to regulate financial services in Switzerland, whether provided by a Swiss-based business or on a cross-border basis from Switzerland or to clients in Switzerland. The rules are largely based on EU directives – the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), the Prospectus Directive and Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance-Based Products (PRIIPs) – with adjustments tailored to the Swiss market.In a nutshell, with regard to fintech, the new legal framework brought additional regulatory requirements to the extent that fintech companies provide financial services in Switzerland or to Swiss clients (application of FinSA) or provide asset management services or other regulated services (application of FinIA and new licensing requirements). \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.3 Compensation Models\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThere are no specific rules on the amount of fees that fintech companies may charge their customers. However, Swiss law provides for a number of disclosure obligations in relation to financial service fees, including the following:retrocessions, kickbacks, rebates and similar payments or financial benefits need to be disclosed (including payments received from other group companies) prior to entering into a contract/transaction; the disclosure has to be specific and, where the exact fees cannot be calculated at the outset of the transaction, the fee disclosure has to include the relevant percentages and calculation methodologies;unless a client has specifically and expressly waived its rights, retrocessions, kickbacks and similar payments need to be handed over in full to the customer; andwhere a key information document (KID) needs to be prepared and handed over to Swiss private clients (ie, with respect to collective investment schemes and structured products), a detailed fee disclosure will have to be included in the KID.For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that FinSA also provides for certain rules against abusive conduct by financial service providers (such as third-party distributors of the products) that are relevant in relation to fees. For example, a financial service provider may not invoice a price that differs from the effective execution price when processing client orders. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.4 Variations Between the Regulation of Fintech and Legacy Players\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nRecently, the legislator’s focus has been on adapting the applicable legal and regulatory framework to the needs of the fintech sector. The Swiss legislator has subsequently introduced three measures within Swiss banking legislation aimed at promoting innovation in the financial sector:any amount of monies can now be held on settlement accounts (eg, for crowdfunding projects) for up to 60 days (as opposed to seven days, as was the case);a sandbox has been created where companies can accept public deposits of up to CHF1 million without having to apply for a banking or fintech licence, subject to certain conditions, such as disclosures and prohibitions against investing these deposits; andthere is a new fintech licence suitable for businesses whose activity involves some form of deposit-taking, but without any lending activities involving maturity transformation (see 2.5 Regulatory Sandbox). \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.5 Regulatory Sandbox\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to the regulatory sandbox (see 2.4 Variations Between the Regulation of Fintech and Legacy Players), under the fintech licence, a company is allowed to accept public deposits provided that:the total amount of deposits does not exceed CHF100 million;the deposits do not bear interest (or are not otherwise remunerated); andthe deposits are not re-invested by the company (ie, they are not used for on-lending purposes).Fintech licences involve less stringent regulatory requirements than a banking licence. Strict banking equity ratio requirements, as well as liquidity requirements, do not apply. In addition, there are lower minimum capital requirements: fintech licence holders must maintain capital amounting to 3% of public deposits, but in any case not less than CHF300,000. In 2023, FINMA published its revised guidelines for the fintech licence, setting out the information and documentation needed to apply for one. These include a list of all participants holding a direct or indirect interest of 5% in the applicant, information on the governing bodies and the activities of the company, plus a three-year financial forecast.To be clear, the fintech licence is not a banking licence, and companies operating under such a licence do not qualify as banking institutions and may not be designated as such. By extension, client deposits are not covered by the Swiss deposit protection scheme, and clients must be duly informed of this, as well as of the attendant risks. In March 2020, FINMA granted the first fintech licence to an app-based bank called Yapeal. The other three companies holding a fintech licence are Bivial, Relio and SR Saphirstein. At least two more former fintech licence holders have already been put into liquidation. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.6 Jurisdiction of Regulators\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFINMA is generally responsible for authorisation, supervision and enforcement under Swiss financial market laws. FINMA adopts a risk-oriented approach to supervision, meaning examinations depend on the risk posed by the respective financial market participant. The applicable financial market laws are enforced by FINMA, which may include administrative measures where necessary. FINMA’s powers include precautionary measures and measures to restore compliance with the law, withdrawing authorisation, liquidating unauthorised companies, issuing industry bans and ordering the disgorgement of profits generated illegally. It can also publish final decisions naming those involved. Since naming companies or individuals is restricted by law, FINMA generally only publishes information on ongoing or completed enforcement proceedings if there is a particular public interest – eg, to protect investors, creditors or policyholders.Besides FINMA, criminal prosecution authorities and self-regulatory organisations (SROs) are involved in enforcing financial market laws. Where irregularities fall under criminal law, FINMA may file a complaint with the competent authorities (Federal Department of Finance (FDF), Office of the Attorney General and cantonal prosecutors). There are other authorities, such as the Competition Commission and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, which may also enforce relevant laws. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.7 No-Action Letters\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFINMA has a practice of issuing no-action letters upon request for specific factual circumstances presented to FINMA in detail in writing. FINMA only issues no-action letters as regards regulatory aspects under laws that FINMA enforces (eg, AMLA, FinIA, the Banking Act) but not for any other laws (eg, data protection laws). No-action letters are subject to a fee. Their validity is limited to the requesting party and only to the extent the actually implemented business fully corresponds to the factual circumstances presented to FINMA. Due to the high demand for no-action letters in the fintech sector (approximately 100 per year according to FINMA), FINMA has created a dedicated team for fintech matters that, among others, deals with these requests from the fintech sector. Note that with other Swiss authorities (eg, in the area of data protection), no-action letters are less common. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.8 Outsourcing of Regulated Functions\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe outsourcing of significant business areas of regulated entities is subject to certain requirements. In essence, Swiss financial market law sets forth three different outsourcing regimes.The outsourcing of a significant business area by a bank (including holders of the fintech licence; see 2.5 Regulatory Sandbox) does not require FINMA approval provided the requirements of FINMA Circular 2018/3 Outsourcing (the “Outsourcing Circular”, which applies to banks, insurers, managers of collective assets, fund managers and securities firms) and applicable data protection legislation are complied with. Courtesy notifications to FINMA should be considered for material outsourcing transactions.Under FinIA, financial institutions (eg, asset managers, trustees, securities firms and fund managers) must reflect the functions being outsourced as well as the possibility of sub-outsourcing in their organisational regulations, which are subject to FINMA approval.The outsourcing of essential functions by insurance or reinsurance companies domiciled in Switzerland (or Swiss branches of foreign insurance companies) constitutes a business plan change which must be notified to FINMA. Notification must be made within 14 days after the signing date of the outsourcing agreement and is considered approved by FINMA unless an investigation is opened within four weeks after notification has been made.Each entity subject to one of the foregoing outsourcing regimes continues to bear responsibility for the outsourced business areas, so it must ensure the proper selection, instruction and control of the supplier. Furthermore, it is a common requirement in all outsourcing regimes to conclude a written contract with the supplier that sets out, among other things, clearly assigned responsibilities as well as audit and inspection rights. If a significant function is outsourced, the service provider is subject to information and reporting duties to, and audits by, FINMA.Regulated entities subject to the Outsourcing Circular must comply with the detailed measures set out therein, including:the obligation to keep an inventory of all outsourced services (which must include proper descriptions of the outsourced function, the name of the service provider and any subcontractors, the service recipient and the person or department responsible within the company);conclusion of a written contract with the supplier setting out, among others, security and business continuity requirements; andif outsourcing to a foreign supplier, ensuring that restructuring or resolving the company in Switzerland remains possible, and that the information required for this purpose is accessible in Switzerland at all times.Regulated entities subject to FinIA may only delegate tasks to third parties who have the necessary skills, knowledge, experience and authorisations to perform that task. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.9 Gatekeeper Liability\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFINMA-regulated entities, as well as those responsible for their management, must provide guarantees of irreproachable business conduct. Furthermore, regulated entities, as well as their statutory auditors, are required to notify FINMA of any events that are of material relevance to FINMA’s supervision. Therefore, to a certain extent, fintech providers that are FINMA-regulated also act as gatekeepers.From a civil law perspective and as a general principle, a fintech provider would be liable for damages resulting from negligence or wilful misconduct in breach of applicable law or contractual obligation. However, under Swiss civil law, liability can be limited or even excluded to a large extent by contractual agreement. Civil liability would thus have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.10 Significant Enforcement Actions\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFINMA has executed several enforcement proceedings in the fintech industry, in particular in the case of initial coin offerings (ICOs) that were suspected of acting as a bank without being authorised to do so (ie, accepting deposits from the public without a banking licence; see 2.2 Regulatory Regime). In its annual report 2022, FINMA stressed its supervisory focus on capital and liquidity requirements. In relation to this, FINMA stated in its annual report for 2022 that certain companies holding a fintech licence faced financial obligations that threatened their solvency and/or liquidity. As a result, FINMA had to withdraw a fintech licence for the first time.Only in very few cases did FINMA make individual enforcement cases public:in September 2017, FINMA ruled that the e-coin issued by QUID PRO QUO Association with the involvement of DIGITAL TRADING AG and Marcelco Group AG constituted fake cryptocurrency – in addition, FINMA ruled that the e-coin involved the acceptance of deposits from the public for which the issuer was not authorised (all three entities involved with the e-coin were liquidated);in March 2019, FINMA ruled that the EVN-Token issued by envion AG, which offered a repayment claim after 30 years, constituted the acceptance of deposits from the public for which the issuer was not authorised – envion AG had accepted deposits in an amount exceeding CHF90 million from at least 37,000 investors and was already in liquidation prior to FINMA’s order due to violation of corporate law requirements; andin May 2023, FINMA ruled that the Dohrnii Foundation and its founder and former managing director had carried out several business activities requiring a licence in the crypto sector without obtaining the relevant licence from FINMA, and that the foundation is currently being liquidated by the competent bankruptcy authority.FINMA also maintains a warning list on its website of individuals and entities who are presumed to carry out unauthorised activities under financial market regulations. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.11 Implications of Additional, Non-Financial Services Regulations\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe processing of personal data by private persons and federal bodies is regulated in particular by the Data Protection Act (DPA) and the Data Protection Ordinance (DPO), which in their recently revised versions entered into force on 1 September 2023. The revised DPA is largely modelled after the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and provides for considerable organisational and administrative requirements, as well as significant sanctions. The DPA and the DPO apply, with some exceptions, to the processing of data relating to natural persons. Personal data must be protected against unauthorised processing by appropriate technical and organisational measures.In addition, the protection of data is, in the banking sector, also governed by the requirements on critical data in the revised FINMA Circular 2023/1 Operational Risks and Resilience – Banks. Critical data is data that, in view of the institution’s size, complexity, structure, risk profile and business model, is of such crucial significance that it requires increased security measures. The criticality of such data is determined by assessing its confidentiality, integrity and availability.In addition, the Federal Act on Information Security (ISecA) and its implementing ordinances entered into force on 1 January 2024. While the ISecA primarily focuses on government cybersecurity, a revision adopted on 29 September 2023 requires critical infrastructure operators, including private parties, to report cyber-attacks to the National Cyber Security Centre within 24 hours. This obligation applies since 1 April 2025, inter alia, to companies that are subject to the Banking Act (see 2.2 Regulatory Regime), Insurance Supervisory Act (ISA; see 8.2 Treatment of Different Types of Insurance) or Financial Markets Infrastructure Act (FMIA; see 6. Marketplaces, Exchanges and Trading Platforms). The new reporting obligation is expected to take effect in the first half of 2025.With regard to cybersecurity, non-binding guidelines with respect to minimum security requirements for telecommunication services have been issued by the competent regulator – the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM). However, there is no cross-sector cybersecurity legislation in Switzerland that would generally be applicable to fintech companies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.12 Review of Industry Participants by Parties Other than Regulators\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe following are the most notable authorities and organisations involved in Swiss financial market regulation.Financial intermediaries operating on a commercial basis are subject to AMLA (see 2.2 Regulatory Regime) and must, unless otherwise supervised by FINMA (eg, as a bank), become a member of a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) recognised by FINMA. While having limited enforcement powers, SROs are responsible for supervising compliance with the due diligence obligations of the financial intermediaries. FINMA, in turn, actively supervises the SROs.Banks, insurers, managers of collective assets, fund managers and securities firms are required by financial market regulation to mandate an independent audit firm supervised by the Federal Audit Oversight Authority (FAOA) as statutory auditor.Under FinIA, asset managers and trustees are required to associate themselves with an independent, privately organised supervisory organisation (SO), while FINMA retains the competence to authorise asset managers and trustees as well as to conduct any respective enforcement proceedings. The ongoing supervision of asset managers and trustees is delegated to the SO, which in turn must obtain authorisation from FINMA and is itself supervised by FINMA.Furthermore, there are many private for-profit and not-for-profit organisations active in the fintech industry that are helping to define industry standards. Most notably, the Swiss Bankers Association has defined several standards applied by banks – eg, on opening corporate accounts for DLT companies. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.13 Conjunction of Unregulated and Regulated Products and Services\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough no specific rules on the conjunction of unregulated and regulated products and services apply, financial service providers are required to take appropriate measures to avoid conflicts of interest. As a general principle, most regulated entities (eg, asset managers, managers of collective assets, insurers) are also required by law to pursue activities only related to their respective regulatory status. FINMA may, however, grant exemptions subject to applicable laws. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.14 Impact of AML and Sanctions Rules\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nMany fintech companies are likely to qualify as financial intermediaries and may, therefore, be subject to AMLA.Fintech companies subject to AMLA are not only required to join an SRO (unless otherwise supervised by FINMA – eg, as a bank), but AML obligations also include due diligence obligations (including KYC rules and record-keeping obligations), reporting obligations in the event of a suspicion of money laundering or obligations to freeze assets under certain conditions. AMLA is relatively easy to comply with and should not represent a significant entry barrier. However, dealing with the associated costs requires careful planning, and business models may need to be adapted. This applies particularly to fintech companies providing alternative finance (eg, crowd investment) platforms, payment services or the professional purchasing and selling of virtual currencies.As regards sanction rules, the Federal Council adopted the sanctions packages imposed by the EU in view of the war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine for Switzerland on 28 February 2022. The Federal Council has since consistently updated the Swiss sanctions regime to take account of additional EU sanctions packages that have been enacted in the meantime (subject to very limited exemptions). The Swiss Federal Ordinance is instituting measures in connection with the situation in Ukraine including, among others, financial sanctions against certain listed individuals and businesses and bans on providing certain financial services to Russian nationals as well as individuals and businesses residing in the Russian Federation. Compliance with sanctions may be operationally challenging and requires utmost care, as breaches of sanctions regulations may result in legal and reputational risks for fintech companies. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) maintains a public website with information and guidance on export control and sanctions. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.15 Financial Action Task Force Standards\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nSwitzerland has been a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) since 1990 and, according to the Swiss federal government’s published financial market policy, is actively involved in the work of the FATF for effective and appropriate solutions and the uniform implementation of standards worldwide.In the FATF’s most recent full assessment of Switzerland’s AML/combatting the financing of terrorism (CFT) regime, the FATF found that it “is technically robust and has achieved good results”, but that it “would still benefit from some improvements”. In its most recent follow-up report, the FATF attested Switzerland has made “progress in addressing the technical compliance deficiencies identified”.In 2024, the Federal Council published draft legislation that would, among other things, introduce into AMLA a mandatory transparency register on beneficial owners of legal entities and expand AMLA’s applicability to certain advisors, including lawyers. This proposed legislation, which is subject to parliamentary proceedings and will therefore not enter into force before 2026 at the earliest, would address the outstanding deficiencies identified by the FATF. \\n\\n\\n\\n 2.16 Reverse Solicitation\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFinSA generally applies to the provision of financial services in Switzerland or to Swiss residents (see 2.2 Regulatory Regime). However, it contains a reverse solicitation exemption, whereby financial services provided to clients in Switzerland by foreign financial service providers are not covered/governed by the FinSA if: the entire client relationship or individual/specific financial services have been requested by clients on their express initiative;the relevant specific financial service has not been advertised or solicited by any other means to the relevant client prior to such client’s enquiry; andthe service in question does not go beyond the scope of the original request.Therefore, the reverse solicitation results in a narrow exemption and customarily is not sufficient to serve as a business model, as it does not allow for systematic market services in the Swiss market.Note that reverse solicitation is not relevant for most other Swiss financial market acts (eg, AMLA) as these only apply in case of the service being provided in or from Switzerland (ie, these acts do not apply to cross-border service provision; see also 5.2 Regulation of Cross-Border Payments and Remittances). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        3. Robo-Advisers\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 3.1 Requirement for Different Business Models\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Switzerland, financial advisers that provide financial advice or investment management online, so-called robo-advisers, are growing in popularity. In particular, those between the ages of 24 and 35 are expected to make up the customer base of online investment solutions, since they often adopt new technologies quickly and prefer self-service approaches. There are several companies that pursue a robo-adviser business model based on mathematical rules or algorithms and allocate, manage and optimise clients’ assets.With regard to automated investment advice, there are no specific applicable rules or regulations. Swiss law is generally technology-neutral and principle-based. FINMA actively contributes to a fintech-friendly legal environment. FINMA regards innovation as key to Switzerland’s competitiveness as a financial centre, but adopts an essentially neutral approach to certain business models and technologies. FINMA has therefore been enhancing the regulatory framework to facilitate client onboarding via digital channels and has reviewed whether specific provisions in its ordinances and circulars disadvantaged some technologies, concluding that very few such obstacles existed. Therefore, FINMA has adopted its guidelines for asset management and has removed the requirement that asset management agreements have to be concluded in writing. Also, FINMA has eased the rules of the onboarding process for new businesses via digital channels. \\n\\n\\n\\n 3.2 Legacy Players’ Implementation of Solutions Introduced by Robo-Advisers\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nConcerning legacy players’ implementation of solutions introduced by robo-advisers, see 3.1 Requirement for Different Business Models. \\n\\n\\n\\n 3.3 Issues Relating to Best Execution of Customer Trades\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nUnder FinSA, financial service providers need to ensure that client orders are always executed in the best possible way with regard to the financial terms, timing of execution and other terms and conditions. Providers define, in a best execution policy to be reviewed annually, the criteria necessary for the execution of client orders. This includes the price, costs, timeliness and probability of execution and settlement. Upon the request of the client, the financial service provider evidences that the respective customer trades have been executed in compliance with these criteria. Regulatory best execution requirements do not apply in relation to institutional clients. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        4. Online Lenders\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 4.1 Differences in the Business or Regulation of Fiat Currency Loans Provided to Different Entities\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nCrowdlending refers to loans for funding companies or individuals, which are consequently categorised as borrowed capital. Crowdlending is also known as P2P or social lending because funding is provided by individuals or companies that are not financial institutions or financial intermediaries. Referring to the distinguishing criterion mentioned in the foregoing to differentiate subtypes of crowdfunding, participants (funding providers) receive a payment in return for making their funding available to the project developer (borrower), typically in the form of interest, although participating loans or bond/note issuances are also possible. The amount of interest or return payment varies depending on the risk of the project and borrower, but it is usually lower than what traditional banks charge. There are a number of crowdlending businesses in Switzerland that offer loans to both private persons and companies.Generally, crowdlending is subject to general financial services regulation, including AMLA (see 2.2 Regulatory Regime). Also, under the Swiss Consumer Credit Act (CCA), only authorised lenders can provide consumer loans. Lenders need to register with the Swiss canton where they are established or, if activities are conducted on a cross-border basis by foreign lenders, with the Swiss canton where they intend to perform their services.Certain amendments to the consumer credit legislation came into force on 1 April 2019. Consumer loans that are obtained through a crowdlending platform are required to comply with the same consumer protection provided by the law as if they were extended by a professional lender. Certain implementing provisions in the Consumer Credit Ordinance have also been adopted, such as access to consumer credit information systems and professional indemnity insurance requirements for crowdlending platforms. \\n\\n\\n\\n 4.2 Underwriting Processes\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nConcerning underwriting processes, see 4.1 Differences in the Business or Regulation of Loans Provided to Different Entities. \\n\\n\\n\\n 4.3 Sources of Funds for Fiat Currency Loans\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nConcerning the syndication of fiat currency loans, see 4.1 Differences in the Business or Regulation of Loans Provided to Different Entities. \\n\\n\\n\\n 4.4 Syndication of Fiat Currency Loans\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nWith regard to loans and loan syndication, it is predominantly banks that are active in the relevant market in Switzerland. There are a number of reasons for this, one being the Swiss tax law rules commonly referred to as the “Swiss non-bank rules”. The basis for these rules is that, under Swiss domestic tax law, payments by a Swiss borrower under bilateral or syndicated financing are generally not subject to Swiss withholding tax. This, however, requires compliance with Swiss non-bank rules. In a nutshell, these rules require that:a syndicate does not consist of more than ten lenders that are not licensed as banks, if there is a Swiss obligor (the ten non-bank rule);a Swiss obligor does not, in aggregate (ie, not on a transaction-specific level), have more than 20 lenders that are not licensed as banks (the 20 non-bank rule); anda Swiss obligor does not, in aggregate (ie, not on a transaction-specific level), have more than 100 creditors not licensed as banks under financings that qualify as deposits within the meaning of the relevant rules (the 100 non-bank rule).To ensure compliance with the Swiss non-bank rules, a number of provisions are included in facility agreements with Swiss borrowers, guarantors or security providers. Depending on the structure, these include assignment and transfer restrictions that limit the ability of lenders to sell down the facilities to more than a specified number of non-bank lenders. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        5. Payment Processors\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 5.1 Payment Processors’ Use of Payment Rails\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe payment market in Switzerland has undergone significant changes in recent years. Since the introduction of the first mobile payment app, the Swiss market has experienced a surge of new entrants, leading to a rapid consolidation process. There are many electronic payment systems that rely, at least partially, on classic credit or debit card payment schemes; they use technology to facilitate payments at the point of sale in the context of e-commerce or, in some cases, between individuals (P2P). A recent study found that in 2024, for the first time, mobile payment became the most used form of payment in Switzerland. Also, the Swiss interbank clearing in 2024 introduced instant payments for the first time for around 60 participating institutions, covering approximately 95% of the Swiss retail payment market.Besides credit and debit card-based payments, some payment apps can be linked to traditional bank accounts with partnering banks. The user experience is similar, but the payment is executed as a bank transfer – ie, the payer authorises the payment service provider to deduct the relevant amount from their bank account and to transfer it to the recipient’s bank account (often routed via a bank account of the payment service provider, subject to a fee). These systems are often operated or sponsored by banks and may therefore be subject to fewer regulatory constraints. \\n\\n\\n\\n 5.2 Regulation of Cross-Border Payments and Remittances\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swiss AML regime (see 2.2 Regulatory Regime and 2.14 Impact of AML and Sanctions Rules) only covers financial intermediaries that have a physical presence in Switzerland and generally does not extend to foreign institutions active on a cross-border basis. For example, foreign payment service providers operating exclusively through electronic channels or the internet are usually not subject to AMLA. However, regardless of AMLA’s application, the general prohibition against money laundering under criminal law still applies. Institutions offering cross-border payments in or from Switzerland would of course have to be fully compliant with AMLA, including on KYC.FinSA applies to financial services, defined as certain services in relation to financial instruments and not including typical payment services. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        6. Marketplaces, Exchanges and Trading Platforms\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 6.1 Permissible Trading Platforms\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nMarketplaces and trading platforms are regulated by the Financial Markets Infrastructure Act (FMIA). Under the FMIA, organised trading facilities for the multilateral trading of securities and other financial instruments require authorisation from FINMA. Trading facilities can seek authorisation as either a stock exchange or a multilateral trading facility. Furthermore, authorised banks, marketplaces (ie, stock exchanges or multilateral trading facilities) and securities firms may also operate an organised trading facility without additional authorisation.The FMIA also regulates payment systems. However, they do not need authorisation from FINMA, unless the payment system’s authorisation is essential for the financial market’s proper functioning or the protection of its participants. Currently, there is no authorised payment system in Switzerland. The Federal Council has recently proposed draft legislation that would clarify and potentially slightly expand the scope, but such legislation will enter into force in 2027 at the earliest.Regarding the trading of digital assets, the DLT/blockchain legislation introduced, in 2021, the so-called DLT trading facility as an additional licence (see 10.2 Local Regulators’ Approach to Blockchain). The main differences from the current regulation are that the new DLT trading facility licence allows individuals to participate in such a trading facility without an intermediary, and settlement and trading services are to be provided by a single entity. FINMA authorised the first DLT trading facility, BX Digital, on 18 March 2025. \\n\\n\\n\\n 6.2 Regulation of Different Asset Classes\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe FMIA essentially differentiates between two asset classes:derivatives or derivative transactions – financial contracts whose value depends on one or several underlying assets and which are not cash transactions; andsecurities – standardised certificated and uncertificated securities, derivatives and intermediated securities, which are suitable for mass trading.With respect to derivatives, the FMIA foresees additional obligations, such as:clearing through a central counterparty;the use of authorised trading facilities; andposition limits in the case of commodity derivatives.The FMIA is generally technology-neutral and applies identically to tokens that meet the criteria to constitute a security or a derivative. The one relevant exemption is that there is a separate DLT trading facility, which is a trading venue for DLT-based securities only (see 10.2 Local Regulators’ Approach to Blockchain). \\n\\n\\n\\n 6.3 Impact of the Emergence of Cryptocurrency Exchanges\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nBy definition, decentralised systems are particularly vulnerable to anonymity risks. Indeed, in contrast to traditional financial services, virtual currency users’ identities are generally unknown, although in most cases, they are only pseudonymous, and there may be no regulated intermediary that serves as a gatekeeper to mitigate money laundering and financing of terrorism risks. Most virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, use a pseudonymous blockchain, meaning that a user’s identity is not linked to a particular wallet or transaction. However, while a user’s identity is not visible on the distributed ledger, anyone can access and view the transaction information – such as dates, value and the counterparties’ addresses – that is publicly recorded on it. Therefore, enforcement authorities can, in the course of their investigations, track transactions where a user’s identity is linked to an account or address (such as wallet providers or exchange platforms).Swiss AML legislation does not provide for a definition of virtual currencies. However, since the revision of the FINMA AML Ordinance in 2015, exchange activities in relation to virtual currencies – eg, money transmission with a conversion of virtual currencies between two parties – are subject to AML rules. In general, the exact scope of regulation applicable to cryptocurrency exchanges depends on the level of decentralisation and activities involved (see 6.1 Permissible Trading Platforms) as well as the economic function and transferability of the blockchain-based units – ie, tokens (see 10.2 Local Regulator’s Approach to Blockchain and 10.3 Classification of Blockchain Assets).Most recently, FINMA issued specific guidance for the staking of crypto-assets and for stablecoins in 2023 and 2024, respectively. \\n\\n\\n\\n 6.4 Listing Standards\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe FMIA requires authorised stock exchanges and multilateral trading facilities to implement appropriate self-regulation, which is binding on the respective participants. SIX Swiss Exchange, as the dominant stock exchange, issues listing rules that have been amended to reflect the new financial market regulation (see 2.2 Regulatory Regime). \\n\\n\\n\\n 6.5 Order Handling Rules\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe FMIA requires authorised stock exchanges and multilateral trading facilities to implement rules on orderly and transparent trading, and to monitor trading in order to detect violations of statutory and regulatory provisions. The detailed rules are thus issued by the relevant trading facility – eg, SIX Swiss Exchange. Furthermore, best execution rules apply (see 3.3 Issues Relating to Best Execution of Customer Trades). Note that these rules would not apply to tokens that do not constitute a security. \\n\\n\\n\\n 6.6 Rise of Peer-to-Peer Trading Platforms\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nUnder the FMIA, organised trading facilities for trading securities and other financial instruments require the relevant FINMA authorisation (see 6.1 Permissible Trading Platforms), which includes strict limitations – eg, on authorised participants in such a trading facility. The new DLT trading facility allows, to a certain extent, for P2P trading of digital assets (see 6.1 Permissible Trading Platforms). \\n\\n\\n\\n 6.7 Rules of Payment for Order Flow\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe rules on best execution (see 3.3 Issues Relating to Best Execution of Customer Trades) as well as the general principles on fees apply (see 2.3 Compensation Models).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n 6.8 Market Integrity Principles\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe FMIA is designed to ensure the transparency and proper functioning of the securities markets, and stipulates two types of market abuse, which are described in the following.Insider TradingThe use of insider information is unlawful if the person knows or should know that it is insider information and such person:exploits it to buy or sell securities admitted to trading on a trading venue in Switzerland or to use financial instruments derived from such securities; discloses it to another person; orexploits it to recommend to another person the acquisition or sale of securities admitted to trading on a trading venue in Switzerland or to use financial instruments derived from such securities.Market ManipulationIt is unlawful to publicly disseminate information, or to carry out transactions or give buy or sell orders, if the person knows or should know that such behaviour gives false or misleading signals regarding the supply, demand or price of securities admitted to trading on a trading venue in Switzerland.In addition, most FINMA-supervised institutions must also meet certain organisational requirements regarding market integrity, which FINMA has detailed in its Circular 2013/8 Market Conduct Rules. The requirements include investigating trades that may involve unlawful market behaviour (if there are clear indications of this), handling insider information in a way that prevents unlawful market behaviour and enables its detection, ensuring that people who decide on securities and/or derivative transactions do not have access to insider information and monitoring employee transactions. Note that Circular 2013/8 in principle also applies to markets where the FMIA rules on insider trading and market manipulation do not apply (eg, trading outside of stock exchanges, including in tokens). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        7. High-Frequency and Algorithmic Trading\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 7.1 Creation and Usage Regulations\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nAlgorithmic trading is based on computer algorithms that automatically determine the triggering and individual parameters of an order (such as time, price or quantity). High-frequency trading is an extension of algorithmic trading, having very low delays in order transmission and, usually, a short-term trading strategy. Its distinctive feature is a high number of order entries, changes or deletions within microseconds.The FMIA and the related Financial Market Infrastructure Ordinance (FMIO) have introduced measures to address certain negative effects of algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading. The regulation follows international standards and is based on EU law.Specifically, stock exchanges, multilateral trading systems and organised trading systems must ensure orderly trading. In particular, they must ensure that their trading systems are in a position to temporarily suspend or restrict trading if there is a significant price movement in the short term as a result of an effect on this market or a neighbouring market (so-called circuit breakers). It must also be possible to identify orders generated by algorithmic trading.In addition, traders who engage in algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading are subject to various obligations. In particular, they must ensure their systems cause no disruption to the trading venue and are subject to appropriate testing of algorithms and control mechanisms. Furthermore, certain transparency requirements apply (see 7.2 Requirement to Register as Market Makers When Functioning in a Principal Capacity). It should be emphasised that higher fees may be charged for typical high-frequency trading techniques. \\n\\n\\n\\n 7.2 Requirement to Be Licensed or Otherwise Register as Market Makers When Functioning in a Principal Capacity\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nPursuant to the FMIO, authorised trading facilities are required to impose upon all participants an obligation to notify the trading facility of the use of algorithmic trading and to flag all orders made by algorithmic trading.In addition, a market participant requires authorisation as a securities firm by FINMA pursuant to FinIA if:it trades in securities in its own name for the account of clients;it trades in securities for its own account on a short-term basis and publicly quotes prices for individual securities upon request or on an ongoing basis; orit trades in securities for its own account on a short-term basis, operates primarily on the financial market and is a member of a trading facility. \\n\\n\\n\\n 7.3 Regulatory Distinction Between Funds and Dealers\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe transparency requirements in relation to algorithmic trading apply to all market participants alike (see 7.2 Requirement to Register as Market Makers When Functioning in a Principal Capacity). In addition, fund managers are subject to the regulatory regime under FinIA, and funds are governed by the Collective Investment Schemes Act, while dealers may qualify as securities firms (see 7.2 Requirement to Register as Market Makers When Functioning in a Principal Capacity). \\n\\n\\n\\n 7.4 Regulation of Programmers and Programming\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nUnder Swiss law, there is no specific regulation of programmers and programming. However, the FMIA requires marketplaces to identify and monitor algorithmic and high-frequency trading (see 7.1 Creation and Usage Regulations), which may indirectly affect programmers and programming. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        8. Insurtech\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 8.1 Underwriting Processes\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Switzerland, insurtech has been growing fast, in part due to organisations pursuing business models that are based on general challenges faced by traditional insurers, such as new regulatory frameworks, alternative capital sources and ongoing low interest rates. In general, traditional insurers face lower barriers when entering the insurtech market as they already have the required licences and can focus on developing the technology.To date, there is no specific legislation governing insurtech business models. Therefore, any regulatory implications for insurtech models must be assessed based on the general principles governing insurance services provision, especially those related to FINMA’s insurance supervision objectives. The revised insurance regulations have introduced, among other things, more stringent requirements for insurance intermediation and new criteria for supervision by FINMA as of 1 January 2024. \\n\\n\\n\\n 8.2 Treatment of Different Types of Insurance\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nSwiss insurance supervisory law contains specific provisions for different types of insurance. ISA distinguishes between three kinds of insurance: life insurance, indemnity/non-life insurance and reinsurance. A key point is that life insurers can only offer casualty and sickness insurance besides life insurance. Different rules also apply with regard to capital requirements. Moreover, mandatory sickness insurers follow a completely different regulatory regime under Swiss law. While FINMA is the competent supervisory authority under ISA, the Federal Office of Public Health supervises insurers providing mandatory sickness insurance. Recently revised legislation, which entered into force on 1 January 2024, brought considerable simplifications for reinsurers as well as insurers that only serve professional clients. Also, the rules applicable to insurance intermediaries were revised and generally brought additional requirements and obligations for untied insurance intermediaries (such as insurance brokers). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        9. Regtech\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 9.1 Regulation of Regtech Providers\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nRegtech is a type of fintech focusing on technologies and software that helps companies meet regulatory requirements and stay compliant in a cost-effective and comprehensive way. Regtech software can automate compliance tasks and monitor and detect risks on an ongoing basis.There is currently no specific legislation governing regtech. FINMA has generally welcomed tech applications that help supervised entities comply with regulatory requirements. FINMA may define technical standards and formats if and when there is a market need for them. \\n\\n\\n\\n 9.2 Contractual Terms to Assure Performance and Accuracy\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe general requirements on outsourcing apply when regulated financial service firms use regtech providers (see 2.8 Outsourcing of Regulated Functions). Depending on the specific services involved, a regtech provider must also comply with a service-level agreement and provide for service credit payments and other remedies in order for the customer to measure and enforce performance and accuracy. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        10. Blockchain\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 10.1 Use of Blockchain in the Financial Services Industry\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nDLT, such as various types of blockchain, has been the focus of many public and private initiatives. First, traditional fundraising techniques and processes have been challenged in the last couple of years by the emergence of a new form of capital raising by start-ups in the form of ICOs or token-generating events based on DLT. With the advance of this technology, the focus is now shifting on tokenising traditional assets such as shares and other securities, as well as DLT-based payment solutions.Some Swiss companies have already issued shares on the blockchain, and FINMA has granted banking licences to two dedicated blockchain service providers, AMINA Bank (formerly Seba) and Sygnum. Driven by the fast-moving industry, traditional players such as banks are also increasingly offering services in relation to digital assets and blockchain-related businesses. For example, many of the incumbent banks now offer custody and trading for digital assets. However, few banks have built their own custody and trading infrastructure (eg, Swissquote); most banks rely on a handful of specialised players. Some banks have recently been conducting pilots – eg, in the tokenising of traditional assets or in blockchain-based payments, which seem to be further areas of interest for traditional players. Also of note is the Swiss National Bank’s ongoing Project Helvetia, piloting wholesale central bank digital currency with participating institutions.Several industry bodies, such as the Swiss Bankers Association, Crypto Valley Association and the Capital Market and Technology Association, are promoting the growing blockchain-based business model for traditional and new players alike. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.2 Local Regulators’ Approach to Blockchain\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Switzerland, the general rules largely apply with regard to risks, liability, intellectual property, AML and data privacy.Regarding the application of the existing regulations on tokens and ICOs, FINMA published corresponding guidelines in 2018. Generally, FINMA focuses on the economic function and purpose of the tokens, as well as whether they are tradeable or transferable, in order to classify them as either payment tokens (including cryptocurrencies), utility tokens or asset tokens. The classification of the tokens has an impact on the applicable legal and regulatory framework (see 10.3 Classification of Blockchain Assets). Since then, FINMA has issued further guidelines on money laundering on blockchain, stablecoins and, most recently, staking services.In 2021, new legislation designed to increase legal certainty by removing hurdles for DLT-based applications and limiting risks of misuse entered into force. In a nutshell, the legislative amendments include:a civil law change aimed at increasing legal certainty in the transfer of DLT-based assets;the possibility of segregation of crypto-based assets in the event of bankruptcy; anda new authorisation category, called DLT trading facilities, where such facilities may provide services in the areas of trading, clearing, settlement and custody with DLT-based assets (see 6.1 Permissible Trading Platforms).Overall, these legislative amendments increase market access for fintech companies in the DLT/blockchain field by improving legal certainty and removing certain regulatory barriers.  \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.3 Classification of Blockchain Assets\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFINMA guidelines define three types of token.Payment tokens are synonymous with cryptocurrencies and offer no further functions or links to projects. They may, in some cases, only gain the necessary functionality and become accepted as a means of payment over a period of time – FINMA requires compliance with AML regulations but does not treat such tokens as securities.Utility tokens are tokens that are intended to provide access to a digital functionality or a service; they do not qualify as securities, unless they function, at least partially, as an investment in economic terms.Asset tokens represent assets such as participation in real physical assets, companies, earning streams or an entitlement to dividends or interest payments. Their economic function is, dependent on the terms, analogous to equities, bonds or derivatives – FINMA generally considers asset tokens as securities.FINMA has recently issued separate guidelines on how they treat stablecoins under Swiss law, it being understood that stablecoins are a subgroup of payment tokens.Other authorities (eg, tax authorities) use alternative classifications that are suited to the particular circumstances they are facing. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.4 Regulation of “Issuers” of Blockchain Assets\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nConcerning the regulation of “issuers” of blockchain assets, see 10.3 Classification of Blockchain Assets. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.5 Regulation of Blockchain Asset Trading Platforms\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nConcerning the regulation of blockchain asset trading platforms, see 10.3 Classification of Blockchain Assets. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.6 Staking\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFINMA issued new guidelines in 2023 setting out how they treat staking in their practice. On the one hand, FINMA set out the requirements for licensed institutions offering staking while keeping the clients’ tokens off the institution’s balance sheet. On the other hand, FINMA set out that staking may also be offered by non-licensed institutions, provided that the assets are not in collective custody (which would, however, customarily be the case in case of so-called staking pools) and that AML rules are complied with.FINMA also pointed out that certain legal uncertainties remain, in particular as regards bankruptcy laws. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.7 Crypto-Related Lending\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThere are no specific laws on crypto-related lending. Therefore, the “normal” financial services regulation applies, including the CCA (see 4.1 Differences in the Business or Regulation of Fiat Currency Loans Provided to Different Entities). However, note that lending itself is not an activity that would require a licence by FINMA, unless the institution takes on deposits for its lending activities, in which case a licence under the Banking Act (ie, a fintech licence or a full-fledged banking licence) would be required. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.8 Cryptocurrency Derivatives\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nAs the Swiss financial market law is generally technology-neutral, cryptocurrency derivatives are regulated as derivatives under the applicable legislation, in particular the FMIA and FinSA. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.9 Decentralised Finance (DeFi)\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nNo specific rules on decentralised finance (DeFi) are in place. FINMA, according to its annual report, applies the existing financial market legislation, including any licensing requirements, in a technology-neutral way, including to DeFi projects.As a rule of thumb, truly decentralised projects would typically not trigger licensing requirements in Switzerland, whereas for projects where an individual or legal entity in Switzerland either provides financial services in relation to such DeFi project or actually controls the underlying assets or even the DeFi project itself (eg, by way of governance tokens), licensing requirements under Swiss financial market laws may be triggered.On this basis, Switzerland has recently become quite a popular hub for DeFi projects. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.10 Regulation of Funds\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nFunds may invest in crypto-assets in accordance with the applicable legislation, in particular the Collective Investment Scheme Act (CISA). Most types of funds under the CISA have to be approved by FINMA, and FINMA has so far only approved a limited number of funds that invest in crypto-assets. One reason for this may be that funds must also have most of their assets in custody with a licensed bank, and only a handful of Swiss banks are licensed under the CISA to provide custody services to funds (which may not be the banks who have a crypto custody offering).Since 1 March 2024, it has been possible to set-up so-called limited qualified investor funds (L-QIFs). Unlike all other Swiss fund types, L-QIFs may be set up and managed by duly licensed institutions without approval by FINMA of the specific fund. It is expected that the L-QIF may be a suitable vehicle for investments in crypto-assets. Note that the L-QIF can only be distributed to qualified investors as defined in the CISA. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.11 Virtual Currencies\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nTransactions in cryptocurrencies may be carried out on an anonymous basis, and related money laundering risks are accentuated by the speed and mobility of the transactions made possible by the underlying technology. KYC is the cornerstone of AML and CFT due diligence requirements, and is generally imposed on financial institutions whose AML/CFT legislation is aligned with international standards (see 2. Fintech Business Models and Regulation in General). KYC requires that financial institutions duly identify and verify their contracting parties (ie, customers) and the beneficial owners (namely when their contracting parties are not natural persons) of such assets, as well as their origin.KYC, along with transaction monitoring, enables the tracing of assets and their source. This helps identify indications of money laundering and terrorist financing through the creation of a paper trail. With respect to DLT/blockchain applications, one of the challenges is that KYC and other AML/CFT requirements are designed for a centralised intermediated financial system in which regulatory requirements and sanctions can be imposed by each jurisdiction at the level of financial intermediaries operating on its territory (ie, acting as gatekeepers).In contrast, virtual currency payment products and services rely on a set of decentralised cross-border virtual protocols and infrastructure elements, neither of which has a sufficient degree of control over, or access to, the underlying value (asset) and/or information, meaning that identifying a touch-point for implementing and enforcing compliance with AML/CFT requirements is challenging. \\n\\n\\n\\n 10.12 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Swiss approach to the regulation of crypto-assets is technology-neutral and prioritises substance over form. This means that if crypto-assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), perform a function similar to that of a traditional financial or payment instrument, the regulations governing such instruments would generally apply to the crypto-asset as well. Therefore, whether an NFT and/or an NFT platform triggers regulatory obligations for the parties involved depends on the underlying rights represented by such NFT (if any). To classify an NFT as a payment, utility or asset token, and to determine the regulatory consequences (see 2.2 Regulatory Regime and 10.3 Classification of Blockchain Assets), it is therefore necessary to identify the rights it represents. As a rule of thumb, NFT projects where each NFT is actually unique and not fungible would not trigger licensing requirements in Switzerland.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        11. Open Banking\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 11.1 Regulation of Open Banking\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nSwiss banks have adopted the open banking concept and are implementing innovative business models, particularly in relation to banking infrastructure. This infrastructure may include open banking interfaces (application programming interfaces; APIs), identity and security management systems, information and transaction platforms, finance management systems and financial compliance systems. In May 2023, a group of approximately 40 banks signed a memorandum of understanding on multibanking to foster the adoption of open banking with the goal of enabling initial multibanking offerings for individuals by mid-2025 (memorandum of understanding; MoU). In particular, the MoU aims to improve interoperability and data exchanges between banks, fintechs and other financial institutions, thereby providing customers with a comprehensive overview of their finances.Currently, there is no specific legislation governing open banking in Switzerland (unlike, for example, in the EU). However, the Federal Council set targets for the adoption of open banking in December 2022 and continuously monitors the progress and the eventual need for specific legislation. In its most recent assessment in June 2024, it concluded that the targets have not been fully met and that the next assessment will be performed by the end of 2025.Given the importance of digital transformation for banks and the large size of Switzerland’s established financial sector, fintech organisations specialising in banking infrastructure have access to a large pool of potential customers. The need to meet customer expectations and deliver financial benefits (in terms of increased revenue and reduced operational costs) has accelerated the adoption of open banking solutions, including those based on bank as a platform (BaaP). \\n\\n\\n\\n 11.2 Concerns Raised by Open Banking\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nOpen banking raises several concerns in areas such as data protection, IT security and Swiss banking secrecy. The success of open banking in Switzerland will depend heavily on providing transparent information to clients, obtaining the necessary consents and waivers and adhering to the highest standards of IT security. The slow adoption of open banking in Switzerland may be due to Swiss banking secrecy and the lack of a common standard for open banking, despite an increasing number of open banking initiatives from private actors. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                        12. Fraud\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 12.1 Elements of Fraud\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nUnder Swiss law, the concept of fraud is primarily understood in a criminal context as an offence punishable under the Swiss Criminal Code (SCC), with criminal liability also being applicable to corporations under certain conditions. To qualify as an offence of fraud under the SCC, the perpetrator must:deceive the victim – eg, by making false representations, concealing true facts or reinforcing an erroneous belief;act maliciously, which is the case when the perpetrator uses a structure of lies, fraudulent manoeuvres or staging to deceive the victim – in case of a mere statement of false information by the perpetrator, this may also be considered malicious if the perpetrator either discourages the victim from verifying the information or foresees that the victim will not verify it due to a special relationship of trust;act wilfully and with the intent of unlawfully securing financial gain for itself or a third party; andtrigger an error on the part of the victim and cause the victim to act to the detriment of its own financial interest or those of a third party, thereby suffering damage.In addition to this general notion of fraud, other criminal offences under the SCC applicable in a commercial context may include, to a certain extent, fraudulent and/or injurious conduct, such as forgery of documents, criminal mismanagement and misappropriation, maliciously causing financial loss to another, bribery and corruption offences and money laundering. Beyond the SCC, Swiss financial market laws, as applicable, further provide for certain criminal provisions relating to fraudulent and/or injurious conduct.Finally, Swiss financial market laws, as applicable, require certain organisational measures, which may include adopting fraud prevention and detection measures. Such obligations may arise, for example, from regulations on risk management and internal controls (eg, specified for the banking sector in the FINMA Circular 2023/1 Operational Risks and Resilience – Banks), AML obligations and sanctions rules (see 2.14 Impact of AML and Sanctions Rules) as well as market integrity (see 6.8 Market Integrity Principles). \\n\\n\\n\\n 12.2 Areas of Regulatory Focus\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nIn Switzerland, criminal offences, including fraud (see 12.1 Elements of Fraud), are generally prosecuted by either the competent cantonal public prosecutor’s office or the federal prosecution office of the Swiss Confederation – that is, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG), depending on the specific circumstances of the case. The cantons and Swiss Confederation may further delegate the prosecution and adjudication of contraventions to administrative authorities. Under such delegation, the FDF is the authority responsible for prosecuting violations of the criminal provisions of the Swiss financial market laws.In addition, fraud or non-compliance with organisational measures under applicable Swiss financial market laws in relation to an entity subject to prudential supervision by FINMA may lead to regulatory investigation and administrative enforcement (see 2.6 Jurisdiction of Regulators). Furthermore, if FINMA obtains knowledge of criminal offences, it must notify the competent criminal prosecution authorities and may collaborate in exchanging information. In 2022, FINMA filed five criminal complaints with the cantonal prosecutor’s office, eight with the OAG and 145 with the FDF. FINMA is, however, not empowered to prosecute criminal charges on its own initiative.Both the Swiss crime statistics and FINMA’s enforcement statistics on offences reported to criminal authorities do not indicate the exact motives for or underlying types of registered criminal fraud offences, nor the corresponding regulatory focus. As a general note, 29,314 criminal fraud offences were recorded in Switzerland in 2022. FINMA’s general enforcement actions in the fintech industry are described in 2.10 Significant Enforcement Actions. \\n\\n\\n\\n 12.3 Responsibility for Losses\\r\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nThe liability of a financial services provider has to be assessed based on the specific contractual arrangements it has in place with a given client. Generally speaking, under Swiss law a contractual counterparty becomes liable if it has breached its contract with the customer and has thereby caused the customer damage in a so-called adequately causal manner and provided that it cannot prove that no fault is attributable to it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLenz & Staehelin\\nBrandschenkestrasse 24CH-8027ZurichSwitzerland\\n+41 58 450 80 00\\n+41 58 450 80 01\\nzurich@lenzstaehelin.com\\nwww.lenzstaehelin.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrends and Developments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n            Authors\\r\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKilian Schärli\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReto Luthiger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAndrea Trost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiana Lafita\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMLL Legal\\r\\n            has a fintech practice that stands out for its profound knowledge of and vast experience in the legal and technical aspects of fintech, as well as its comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to finding tailor-made solutions. The practice is well-known at both the national and international scale for providing actionable advice to help clients pursue the untapped possibilities offered by new technologies. MLL Legal was a first mover amongst top-ranked firms in positioning itself within the fintech sector. This early positioning allows the team to understand the practical and legal challenges posed by new technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and the implementation of digital solutions. The firm’s experts are committed to staying up to date with new industry and regulatory trends and frequently publish new developments. Accordingly, some of MLL Legal’s experts are involved with institutional players such as the Swiss government and various fintech associations, contributing their views on new bills, risks and challenges in the fintech sector.\\r\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of the Swiss Fintech Market Thanks to its well-established banking, insurance and asset management industry, highly specialised workforce, stable and robust economy – with low inflation and a strong currency – and flexible and stable political system, Switzerland has excellent market conditions to foster innovation in the financial sector. Hence, Switzerland has adopted an innovative and fintech-friendly regulatory framework over the past ten years to boost the development of Swiss fintech business models, which have now reached a great level of maturity. In the Swiss financial market, there is no longer a clear separation between traditional financial services and fintech models. Almost every financial service offering has undergone a deep technological transformation.The canton of Zug, which is home to the “Crypto Valley”, has attracted numerous international players in the crypto and blockchain space due to its business-friendly environment, clear regulatory framework and competitive tax system. This has created an ecosystem of companies, foundations, associations and networks of individuals and research institutions that not only compete, but also co-operate and exchange information to accelerate innovation in the crypto area. In 2024, the Crypto Valley was home to 17 unicorns in the blockchain industry, with a valuation exceeding USD1 billion.The Main Fintech Technologies and Applications Offered in Switzerland and Their Regulatory FrameworkThe main technologies that thrive in the financial services sector are:digitalisation and online services;blockchain and Web3 applications; andartificial intelligence (AI).The following sections provide key examples and outline the regulatory framework. Digitalisation of financial servicesThe fintech transformation has been driven by a shift to digital and online services and applications, including instant and contactless payment systems, which are now widely used by both retail and businesses. Traditional banks and financial intermediaries have largely maintained their market share by progressively and steadily transforming their services into personalised online offerings. Online banking and financial services applicationsIn Switzerland, online applications that cater to various financial needs, ranging from mobile banking apps to investment platforms, have become the standard channels for individuals and companies to access banking and other financial services. For example, UBS, Raiffeisen, and many other Swiss and foreign banks offer mobile apps that allow their users to manage bank accounts, make transfers, view account statements and more.In asset management, Swissquote leads the market as the most prominent platform providing online trading services, investment solutions and wealth management. True Wealth, Findependent, Inyova, Selma Finance and VIAC are Swiss wealth management platforms that use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to create diversified, low-cost portfolios. Another notable app, Yuh, is a digital investment platform providing users with the ability to invest in stocks, ETFs and other financial instruments through an easy-to-use interface. SwissBorg, primarily focused on cryptocurrencies, offers smart portfolio management and a trading app that simplifies investment in digital currencies. Leonteq provides tailored investment and trading solutions for both institutions and private investors, specialising in structured products. The so-called smartphone banks, or neobanks, are digital-only banks that operate primarily through mobile apps and websites without physical locations. Amongst such players, Radicant, Yapeal, Alpian, Yuh, Fiat24, Neon and Zak lead the market in Switzerland. From a regulatory perspective, digital-only banks operate in the same way as traditional banks and hence require a banking licence based on the technology neutrality of financial market regulations. However, they must adapt their risk management to the relevant business model, implementing adequate business continuity and cyber-risk policies to guarantee access to, and the servicing of, clients’ assets and data. For instance, Neon works with Hypothekarbank Lenzburg (HBL) as a banking partner, and Yapeal and Fiat24 operate under the so-called fintech licence, which offers a simplified regulatory regime and is mainly available for companies accepting public deposits of up to CHF100 million in fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies in an unlimited amount, subject to certain exceptions.Online payment systemsDigital payment solutions and mobile banking are steadily expanding in Switzerland. Contactless payments, mobile wallets, and peer-to-peer payment apps have become increasingly popular among retail and businesses. Both established banks and fintech start-ups provide mobile banking apps with features such as instant payments, money transfers, and account management. The Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC) payment system, powered by SIX Interbank Clearing AG and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), launched instant payments in November 2023. Larger banks have been required to accept incoming instant payments since August 2024, and other banks are required to follow suit by the end of 2026. TWINT, the leading Swiss mobile payment system, enables seamless in-store and online (P2M) and person-to-person (P2P) transactions via mobile phones, removing the need for cash or physical bank cards.Whilst accepting deposits from the public usually requires a banking or fintech licence, the provision of payment services is usually only subject to anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Where the payment service or system includes the acceptance of deposits from the public, the need for a banking licence can be avoided by applying the 60-day settlement exception, by only allowing a credit balance of CHF3,000 per customer or by working with a bank default guarantee, each of which is subject to certain requirements. Service providers and state agencies such as the cantonal tax administration of Zug and the administration of the canton of Tessing increasingly accept payments with Bitcoin. Open bankingOpen banking in Switzerland is gradually evolving, with several companies leveraging the technology to enhance the accessibility and integration of financial services. In Switzerland, open banking is usually based on a standardised exchange of data amongst service providers, ensuring data confidentiality and leaving the decision to share personal data with the customer. In 2023, the Swiss Bankers Association established an open banking framework in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to facilitate open banking, to open interfaces and to facilitate data exchange amongst different stakeholders. Further, OpenBankingProject.ch has been launched to examine how open banking can support the financial services industry.So-called embedded finance, which is a major trend related to open banking, integrates a financial service within another product or service and hence enhances the user experience. The introduction of an electronic identification (e-ID) system, which is expected to launch in 2026, may accelerate the development of embedded finance solutions.Crypto services: use of distributed ledger technology to register ownership and conduct transactions and tradingThe potential of the blockchain and distributed-ledger technology remains largely untapped for the most substantial part of the financial services industry, in Switzerland and abroad, being used only to a very limited extent in asset management. Regulation is mainly to blame for this. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) issued its initial coin offering (ICO) guidelines in 2018, outlining its regulatory practice for the qualification of tokens. Payment tokens (synonymous with cryptocurrencies) are tokens intended to be used, now or in the future, as a means of payment for acquiring goods or services or as a means of money, value storage or transfer. Payment tokens are not treated as financial instruments if they are operational on a blockchain. The acceptance of payment tokens from the public can however trigger the application of the banking or fintech licence regulations. Sygnum Bank and AMINA Bank are well known banks in the fintech space that offer storage of cryptocurrencies. Besides banks, Switzerland has several pure-play wallet providers such as Relai, Swiss Fortress and Thor Wallet. These kinds of providers hold cryptocurrencies in either individual custodial wallets or non-custodial wallets, neither of which is affected by bankruptcy of the service provider. This is the reason why they do not require a banking licence, but in case of custodial wallets may be subject to AML regulations. In contrast, so-called asset tokens, which represent a claim against an issuer (such as a debt or equity claim), qualify as securities if they are standardised and mass-tradable. They are treated according to their economic function, for instance as shares (equity), bonds, derivatives, collective investment schemes or structured products. Their issuance can become subject to financial market regulations, such as licensing for underwriting or derivatives issuance activities, or prospectus obligations. Utility tokens that provide access (digitally) to applications or services through a blockchain-based infrastructure do not qualify as financial instruments and are accordingly not subject to financial market regulations. So far, banks and securities dealers, which already hold the relevant licence, have not issued any stablecoins. Stablecoins have the potential to disrupt payment systems and traditional business models, and can potentially pose a challenge to monetary policy, as they can be seen as a substitute for fiat currencies. In July 2024, FINMA published its Guidance 06/2024 on stablecoins, resulting in a change to its regulatory practice. According to FINMA, the AML regulations now also apply to secondary market transactions by the issuer of a stablecoin. Therefore, regulatory hurdles remain to be overcome for stablecoins to succeed in the Swiss market. At the same time, since December 2023, the SNB has been testing a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) on the regulated platform SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), and Swiss Stablecoin AG has led the initiative with respect to a regulated digital Swiss franc in co-operation with the SNB and FINMA. However, the issuance of a retail digital Swiss franc as a replacement for the fiat currency is politically disputed and therefore not in sight. In Switzerland, there are three licensed trading venues: SIX Swiss Exchange, the traditional stock exchange of the SIX Group; SDX Trading AG, of the same group, designed for the trading of ledger-based securities – ie, securities issued on a blockchain or on another distributed ledger technology (DLT); and the traditional stock exchange of BX Swiss AG. However, SDX Trading AG does not operate a so-called DLT trading venue, which was introduced with the DLT Act in 2021. A DLT trading venue enables the trading of ledger-based securities on the blockchain and allows, with possession of the licence mentioned in the foregoing, (i) direct access for retail, (ii) the holding of ledger-based securities in central custody and (iii) clearing and settlement. Recently, SDX Trading AG has introduced the SDX Web3 service, which provides financial institutions with crypto custody, crypto trading and collateral services with crypto-assets. As the SIX Group is mainly governed by banks, a full decentralisation would not fit their core strategy. The third trading venue is BX Swiss AG, which is also a traditional stock exchange. BX Digital, a sister company of BX Swiss and part of the Boerse Stuttgart Group, will be granted a DLT trading venue licence from FINMA\\xa0in the short term\\xa0on 18 March 2025, becoming\\xa0the first DLT trading facility that allows DLT securities to be traded.\\xa0This development is expected to unlock an important aspect of the DLT potential of the Swiss financial market,\\xa0even though the licence does not\\xa0currently allow\\xa0direct access\\xa0to\\xa0retail, but only to licensed supervised participants. In addition, BX Digital does not offer custody of DLT securities, which must be offered by the relevant participants.A large proportion of the investment in crypto-assets is made into cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ether, which are already offered by private and cantonal banks. In contrast, specialised crypto-native custody providers in Switzerland support, according to a recent survey, up to 1,100 different coins and tokens. Since 2013, Bitcoin Suisse has offered investments in crypto-assets, including storage in individual vaults or collective wallets, where the latter benefits from a default guarantee from Swiss banks. Whilst the individual custody of cryptocurrencies that can be segregated in case of bankruptcy, and that are kept available for the customer at all times, does not trigger a licensing requirement under the Banking Act, the collective custody of cryptocurrencies usually requires a banking or fintech licence unless there is a default guarantee from a bank or another exemption applies. Developments in the field of AIAI, which represents a megatrend, is increasingly being used in the front and back offices of financial institutions, such as in document analysis, compliance and fraud detection, asset and risk management, personalisation and marketing, investment research and process automatisation. The first and most mature model in this field is the chatbot. Chatbots are used by most financial institutions, including insurance companies (eg, in their claims handling) and banks (in their customer service lines). Recent surveys indicate that approximately two-thirds of asset managers are either planning to implement at least one generative AI (GenAI) use case this year. One of the most notable applications is the ability to manage personalised portfolios, improving client satisfaction. AI tools improve risk management by spotting patterns and predicting market changes using advanced data analytics. Switzerland hosts several providers of AI solutions for asset managers, including Avaloq, Advanon, Swissquote, Temenos and Actico.At the end of January 2025, UBS announced that it has joined forces with Microsoft’s Azure AI to power smart assistants that streamline content access and provide real-time information to client advisors, to in turn provide more tailored and efficient services to clients.Structural Impact of Trends in the Industry and Macroeconomic DevelopmentsThe disappearance of intermediariesIn the long run, blockchain technologies combined with AI may eliminate an important part of the value chain, namely the intermediation of services, giving investors direct access and allowing them to take final decisions with efficient AI assistance. This diminishes the counterparty credit risks of using intermediaries and reduces costs. In a world where tokenised securities are becoming more prevalent, collective investment schemes may be significantly impacted because less regulated exchange-traded products (ETPs), non-listed actively managed certificates (AMCs) or an investment strategy crafted by an asset manager might replace the traditional collective investment fund for the management of tokenised securities directly invested from investors’ wallets. The retailisation of servicesThe retailisation trend – ie, the so-called democratisation of investments, is a result of the availability of highly digitised, automated and scalable online asset management solutions for retail and the high costs of traditional intermediaries.In the mid- to long term, tokenisation and DLT trading venues will empower retail to directly make investments, thereby enhancing its financial situation, including more investments in illiquid or non-bankable assets. This could reduce fiat in bank accounts, benefitting direct retail investments in private equity or debt via crowdlending platforms and again removing intermediation. Market structure and competitionHealthy market competition is essential for driving innovation. Due to the merger of Credit Suisse and UBS, there may be certain parts of some business segments that are subject to control by the Swiss Competition Commission. Switzerland has strict competition and anti-trust rules in place to protect competitiveness. Furthermore, Switzerland has a liberal regime with regard to cross-border banking services and providing asset management services in Switzerland. Foreign financial institutions that operate on a strict cross-border basis can provide their services to residents in Switzerland without obtaining a licence. This enhances the competitiveness of foreign players in the Swiss market, though the unequal conditions may not necessarily be fair for Swiss players. Nevertheless, this situation honours the core principles of the WTO’s multilateral General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Foreign service providers that provide an activity subject to licence in Switzerland may not create a physical presence, such as by establishing a branch or representative office or by having employees or agents in Switzerland on a permanent basis, without first obtaining the required Swiss licence or affiliation with a self-regulatory organisation for AML purposes. Revolut is an example of a foreign bank in the fintech sector that ended up establishing a physical presence in Switzerland, now holding a licence as a Swiss representative office. Furthermore, BBVA SA, part of a Spanish group, has a long-standing presence in the Swiss market, holding a fully fledged banking licence. In Switzerland, BBVA has expanded its offerings to include investments in digital assets and online banking and investment applications.Swiss Regulatory TrendsThe main regulatory trends in the Swiss fintech space are as follows.FINMA clarified, at the end of 2023, that custodial staking services generally require a banking licence under the Banking Act, unless assets are staked with individual segregation. The temporary locking of assets by staking protocols, and the risk that assets could be seized from participants in cases of improper validation (slashing), must be considered, especially by regulated players. This clarification enhances legal certainty and will help the staking industry develop more steadily.In December 2023, Switzerland and the UK signed the Berne Financial Services Agreement to strengthen co-operation between the two financial centres. In July 2024, FINMA’s issued its stablecoin guidance, clarifying that the Anti-Money Laundering Act also applies to stablecoin secondary market transactions, though some aspects require further clarification.In March 2024, the limited qualified investor fund (L-QIF) regulation entered into force, providing for a new fund category that does not require a licence and can only be offered to qualified investors. This licence may also be used by funds issuing tokenised fund shares.In December 2024, FINMA issued its Guidance 08/2024 (Governance and risk management when using artificial intelligence) for supervised institutions (including fintech companies) using AI. FINMA highlights AI risks for supervised institutions, emphasising the importance of data quality, explainability, cybersecurity and comprehensive risk management. Institutions must ensure robust governance, ongoing risk assessment and effective management of third-party liabilities and testing protocols. However, it is anticipated that, due to AI’s capabilities in conducting enhanced risk management, it may become a required tool for risk management in the coming years, rather than being considered a risk.In February 2025, the Federal Council published a comprehensive report on AI regulation, outlining three potential regulatory approaches:\\xa0(i)\\xa0continuation of topic- and sector-specific regulatory activities; (ii) ratification of the Council of Europe’s AI Convention; and (iii) alignment with the EU AI Act. The report emphasises the importance of aligning with international standards while preserving Switzerland\\'s innovation-friendly environment. \\u200bIn particular, the Federal Council confirmed that it will maintain Switzerland’s sector-specific regulatory framework rather than implementing a general cross-sector AI law. Further, it confirmed that it will implement the Council of Europe’s AI Convention through sector-specific amendments to existing Swiss laws. Only key areas relevant to fundamental rights, such as data protection, will be subject to general cross-sectoral regulation. There will, therefore, be no Swiss equivalent to the EU AI Act. In addition to legislation, non-legally binding measures (such as self-disclosure agreements) will be developed to help implement the AI Convention. A draft law is expected in 2026.\\xa0Switzerland will implement the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) from 1 January 2026, requiring crypto service providers to report non-Swiss clients to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (SFTA).The State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF) is currently reviewing Switzerland’s fintech architecture and discussing topics such as whether crypto and payment regulations shall be amended, and whether the sandbox and the fintech licence shall continue to exist in their current form.In summary, Switzerland’s fintech landscape is characterised by its innovative regulatory framework, robust digital infrastructure and collaborative ecosystem that fosters growth and development in the financial services sector. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMLL Legal\\nSchiffbaustrasse 28005 ZurichSwitzerland\\n+41 58 552 08 00\\n+41 44 396 91 92\\ninfo@mll-legal.com\\nwww.mll-legal.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLaw and Practice\\n\\n\\r\\n            Authors\\r\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLukas Morscher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLukas Staub\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLenz & Staehelin\\r\\n            provides tailored services to clients operating and investing in all areas of the fintech sector through a dedicated and multidisciplinary fintech team.

The Fintech Landscape\\n\\n1.1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Please describe the types of fintech businesses that are active in your jurisdiction and the state of the development of the market, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) objectives.\\xa0 Are there any notable fintech innovation trends of the past year within particular sub-sectors (e.g. payments, asset management, peer-to-peer lending or investment, insurance and blockchain applications)?\\nSwitzerland offers a friendly environment for companies in the fintech sector.\\xa0 According to a market study, a total of 483 fintech companies were active in Switzerland by the end of 2023 in comparison to 437 by the end of 2022 (an increase of 10.5%).\\xa0 The number of companies active in the field of blockchain/distributed ledger technology (“DLT”) increased to 135 companies in 2022 vs. 113 in 2021 in Switzerland and continued to rise to 175 companies in 2023 in Switzerland and Liechtenstein (all data: IFZ Fintech Study 2024, An Overview of Swiss and Liechtenstein FinTech, pp 6–8).\\xa0 Overall, the Swiss fintech industry is very broadly diversified, and the distinction between fintech and traditional financial services continues to be blurred.\\xa0 Swiss regulation, in principle, takes a technology-neutral, principle-based approach, which has so far enabled the jurisdiction to deal with many innovations in the financial sector without major revisions of laws and regulations.\\xa0 It remains to be seen whether major developments such as the use of large language models and artificial intelligence (“AI”) in fintech or financial services more generally will require amendments to the legal framework in the future.\\nThe fintech sector has faced multiple challenges.\\xa0 E.g. FlowBank, an online bank/trading platform based in Geneva, was declared bankrupt by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”) in 2024 because it no longer had the minimum own funds required, although privileged client deposits are expected to be recovered in full (FINMA media release of 13 June 2024).\\xa0 Furthermore, a number of Swiss fintech businesses were affected by the FTX scandal in 2022 and its enduring effects on the sector.\\xa0 However, the Swiss fintech market also benefits from Switzerland’s reputation as a stable and reliable jurisdiction.\\nSwiss-based fintech businesses are active in areas such as payments, investment and asset management services, exchange services, crowdfunding and crowdlending, insurance-related services (insurtech), regulation/compliance-related services (regtech) as well as in various platform services, e.g. for the purposes of fundraising and/or distribution of financial instruments.\\xa0 Many businesses with a focus on DLT are based in the so-called “Crypto Valley” in the Canton of Zug, Switzerland, which initially became known as a hub for initial coin offerings (“ICOs”).\\xa0 While cryptocurrencies and related services such as staking remain an active topic, security tokens and their issuance and trading infrastructures have in the more recent past received increasing attention.\\xa0 In November 2021, the Swiss stock exchange SIX (“SIX”) launched a separate, fully regulated digital platform under the name SIX Digital Exchange, which provides a fully integrated end-to-end trading, settlement and custody service for digital assets.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn recent years, the market’s focus has included decentralised finance (“DeFi”), which uses smart contracts to minimise the need for financial intermediaries.\\xa0 Although there are many open questions as to the legal and regulatory treatment of DeFi, it has been a rapidly growing sector (FINMA Risk Monitor 2022, p. 19).\\xa0 Further, FINMA has – similarly to the European standard-setter European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) – addressed the topic of AI, recognising that while most institutions are still experimenting with AI, many companies have advanced AI applications that require corresponding risk management processes.\\xa0 Key challenges identified by FINMA in the use of AI include governance and responsibility, robustness and reliability, transparency and explainability as well as non-discrimination (FINMA Risk Monitor 2023, p. 24; see also ESMA’s Public Statement – On the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the provision of retail investment services of 30 May 2024, no. 5).\\nGenerally speaking, the fintech market continues to see more mature projects, many of which are backed or launched by established financial institutions and technology companies.\\xa0 These well-funded start-ups more readily accept and embrace regulation, with several projects aiming to become licensed and supervised by FINMA.\\nSeparately, the demand for sustainable financial services has increased in recent years, and so has the number of sustainability-related financial products that are labelled green or ESG.\\xa0 In this context, FINMA recognised early on the risk of greenwashing and took measures to protect investors and clients, in particular with respect to the supervision of investment funds that focus on sustainability.\\xa0 Furthermore, according to its Risk Monitor report, FINMA in 2021 launched a multi-year project to integrate climate risks into its supervisory practice (FINMA Risk Monitor 2021, p. 19).\\xa0 Among the first measures are transparency requirements regarding climate risks (both quantitative and qualitative) of Swiss banks and insurers.\\xa0 This has further been supplemented through ESG-focused self-regulation in the financial sector, e.g. by the Swiss Bankers Association (“SBA”) and the Asset Management Association Switzerland (“AMAS”).\\xa0 In a further effort to support the development of environmentally conscious fintech businesses, the Swiss Federal Council launched the Green Fintech Network in 2020.\\xa0 The network presented its first action plan with 16 concrete measure proposals in 2021.\\xa0 According to e.foresight, a Swiss banking think tank, in 2024, Switzerland hosted 49 “sustainable” fintech companies, which accounts for 12% of the sector and a 53% increase from 2023 (e.foresight Swiss FinTech Map).\\n1.2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there any types of fintech business that are at present prohibited or restricted in your jurisdiction (for example cryptocurrency-based businesses)?\\nSwitzerland has no specific prohibitions or restrictions in place with respect to fintech businesses or cryptocurrency-related activities, but general Swiss laws and regulations for the financial sector apply.\\xa0 With few exceptions, Swiss financial regulation is technology-neutral and principle-based, which has so far allowed the market and the competent authorities to cope well with technological innovation.\\xa0 Depending on the nature and scope of their business activities, fintech operators may be subject to regulation and supervision by FINMA or by self-regulatory organisations.\\xa0 In accordance with the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules”, FINMA takes an economic approach when assessing the relevance and application of Swiss laws on cryptocurrency-focused businesses such as DeFi projects, e.g. to determine whether compliance with regulation on financial services, anti-money laundering (“AML”), collective investment schemes, financial market infrastructures, banks, insurance companies, securities firms and/or data protection is required (FINMA Risk Monitor 2022, p. 19).\\xa0 Therefore, each case needs to be assessed individually (see question 3.1).\\xa0 With regard to ICOs, stablecoins and cryptocurrencies in particular, FINMA published several guidance papers in which it emphasised the concept of an individual review of each business case regarding the regulatory impact.\\xa0 It is therefore prudent for fintech start-ups to seek clearance from the regulator before launching their project on the market.\\n\\n2. Funding For Fintech\\n\\n2.1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Broadly, what types of funding are available for new and growing businesses in your jurisdiction (covering both equity and debt)?\\nSwitzerland has an active start-up scene and various funding opportunities are available for companies at every stage of development.\\xa0 There are seed and venture capital firms for early funding as well as mature debt and equity capital markets for companies at a later stage.\\xa0 In addition, there are many financial institutions that have a potential interest in buying an equity stake in fintech companies or in a full integration, e.g. to ensure new distribution channels.\\xa0 Foreign investment is also common and not specifically restricted.\\nCrowdfunding and crowdlending as alternative sources of funding had shown rapid growth rates in Switzerland in the last years, further driven by the COVID-19 pandemic (according to the 2021 Crowdfunding Monitor Study of the University of Lucerne, 14,984 projects were crowdfunded via crowdsupporting/crowddonating at a total amount of CHF 44.6 million in the course of 2020), both in terms of the number of platforms and the funds raised; however, since then, crowdfunding has decreased in 2021 and 2022.\\xa0 At the end of April 2023, according to a market study, 35 platforms were maintaining an active physical presence in Switzerland (compared to only four in 2014 and 38 in 2020) and several non-domestic platforms were active on the market on a cross-border basis.\\xa0 The legislator has facilitated crowdfunding and crowdlending platforms by way of the introduction of fintech regulation in Switzerland as follows: (a) on 1 August 2017, the maximum holding period during which the acceptance of funds for the purpose of settlement of customer transactions does not yet qualify as taking deposits from the public (and therefore does not count towards a potential banking or fintech licence requirement) was extended from seven to 60 days; and (b) a so-called “regulatory sandbox” was introduced in the Banking Ordinance, according to which more than 20 deposits from the public can be accepted on a permanent basis without triggering a banking licence requirement, as long as (i) the deposits accepted do not exceed CHF 1 million, (ii) no interest margin business is conducted, and (iii) depositors are informed, before making the deposit, that the person accepting the deposits is not supervised by FINMA and that the deposits are not covered by the Swiss depositor protection scheme (see question 3.2 for further details).\\xa0 Furthermore, on 1 January 2019, a regulatory licence type geared towards fintech operators with a need to hold deposits from the public in limited amounts was introduced in the Banking Act (“BankA”).\\nSwitzerland hosts a range of incubator and accelerator programmes for both Swiss-based and international fintech companies, either exclusively fintech-related (such as the association F10 or Thomson Reuters Labs – The Incubator) or focused on digital innovation in general including fintech (such as Kickstart Accelerator) or blockchain (CV Labs Blockchain Incubator).\\xa0 In addition, there are organised challenges aiming to support mainly fintech companies that generally involve a prize (such as the Swiss Innovation Challenge).\\n2.2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there any special incentive schemes for investment in tech/fintech businesses, or in small/medium-sized businesses more generally, in your jurisdiction, e.g. tax incentive schemes for enterprise investment or venture capital investment?\\nThere are no specific tax or other incentives for the benefit of the fintech industry in Switzerland.\\xa0 However, depending on the tax domicile of the company and the residence of the shareholders, there are certain tax benefits for start-up companies and tax schemes granting some relief to investors.\\nGenerally speaking, depending on the tax domicile of the company, the ordinary profit tax rate in Switzerland can be as low as 11.22% (tax rates vary between the different Swiss cantons and municipalities).\\nFurther, there are various general special regimes for corporate income tax purposes available in Switzerland.\\xa0 Under the patent box regime, cantons tax profits from qualifying patents and comparable rights at a reduced rate for corporate income tax purposes.\\xa0 Cantons can also provide for special R&D “super deductions” from corporate income tax and/or exempt a part of the equity (to the extent attributed to qualifying participations, patents and loans to group companies) from the annual capital tax.\\xa0 Cantons with a statutory cantonal and communal tax rate of at least 13.5% at the cantonal capital may also provide for a notional interest deduction on so-called “security capital”.\\xa0 Only the Canton of Zurich meets this requirement and accordingly introduced the deduction for equity financing.\\nStart-ups may benefit from a tax holiday on the cantonal and federal level if their tax domicile is located in a structurally less developed region of Switzerland.\\xa0 Furthermore, if a company sells a stake of at least 10% of the capital held in another company that has been held for at least one year prior to the sale, a participation deduction can be applied to the realised profit.\\xa0 In addition, Swiss resident individuals are not taxed on capital gains realised on privately held assets.\\xa0 Dividend payments to companies that hold a participation of at least 10% or with a fair market value of at least CHF 1 million in the dividend paying company also benefit from the participation deduction.\\xa0 Dividend payments to Swiss resident individuals on substantial participations of at least 10% are taxed at a reduced rate.\\nSwitzerland levies annual wealth taxes.\\xa0 To lessen the tax burden for start-up investors, start-up companies are often valued at their substance value for wealth tax purposes (e.g. in the Canton of Zurich).\\nIn terms of management/employee incentives, Switzerland offers attractive ways to structure participation schemes.\\xa0 If structured as an equity participation, such schemes generally aim to obtain a tax-exempt capital gain (instead of taxable salary) for the Swiss resident managers upon an exit.\\xa0 However, in case of an acquisition of employee shares for which a fair market value was unavailable or not accepted at the time of acquisition, part of the capital gain at exit might be taxed in case of a sale within five years after the acquisition.\\xa0 In any case, founder shares will not be regarded as employee shares and will as such generally provide for a tax-exempt capital gain.\\nIn Switzerland, it is common to discuss the tax consequences of an envisioned structure with the competent tax administration and there is an uncomplicated process of obtaining advance tax rulings.\\n2.3\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In brief, what conditions need to be satisfied for a business to IPO in your jurisdiction?\\nThe requirements for a listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange (the main Swiss stock exchange) are laid down in its Listing Rules (as revised on 1 September 2024).\\xa0 Essential listing prerequisites include, e.g., (i) that the issuer has existed as a company for at least three years (however, exemptions exist) and has a reported equity capital of at least CHF 25 million.\\xa0 Furthermore, (ii) the securities must meet the minimum free float requirements (at least 20% of all of the issuer’s outstanding securities in the same category have to be held in public ownership, and the capitalisation of those securities in public ownership has to amount to at least CHF 25 million).\\nThe listing requirements of the BX Swiss (the second regulated Swiss stock exchange) are structured in a similar way as those of the SIX Swiss Exchange but are in some areas slightly less stringent, e.g. the issuer must only have existed as a company for at least one year and the share capital and the reported equity must only amount to at least CHF 2 million.\\n2.4\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have there been any notable exits (sale of business or IPO) by the founders of fintech businesses in your jurisdiction?\\nThere have not been any recent IPOs in Switzerland in the area of fintech and IPO activity was generally low (Swiss VC Report 2024, p. 10).\\nThe following acquisition transactions in 2024 might be noteworthy: NetGuardians, a fintech business helping financial institutions to prevent fraud and financial crime, was acquired by Stockholm-based private equity firm Summa Equity.\\xa0 Further, MidFunder, a fintech business specialising in revenue-based financing for companies, was acquired by Levenue.\\xa0 At the end of 2024, the Swiss Fintech Association and the Swiss Finance + Technology Association merged in an effort to enhance their services and collaboration with regulators and policy-makers.\\n\\n3. Fintech Regulation\\n\\n3.1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Please briefly describe the regulatory framework(s) for fintech businesses operating in your jurisdiction, and the type of fintech activities that are regulated.\\nBroadly speaking, the Swiss financial regulatory regime does not specifically address fintech.\\xa0 In fact, the recent new regulations addressing certain requirements for fintech companies in Switzerland have been designed according to the principle of technology-neutrality, meaning that business activities with substantially similar characteristics are subject to the same regulatory requirements irrespective of whether they are provided using advanced technology or in a more traditional format or irrespective of how they are labelled (notwithstanding, there is a regulatory licence type that is colloquially referred to as “fintech licence”; see further below).\\xa0 The intention is to provide a level playing field among innovators and traditional providers engaging in similar businesses with similar risks.\\nThe Swiss legal and regulatory framework governing financial services consists of a number of federal acts and implementing ordinances as well as circulars and other guidance papers issued by FINMA.\\xa0 Fintech business models have to be assessed within this set of rules on a case-by-case basis (see question 1.2).\\nSpecifically, based on their (intended) activities, fintech businesses may, in particular, fall within the scope of the BankA (if engaging in activities involving the professional acceptance of deposits from the public or the public solicitation of deposit-taking or engaging in collective custody of cryptocurrencies; see question 3.2), the Anti-Money Laundering Act (“AMLA”) (if active as a so-called “financial intermediary”, e.g. in connection with payment instruments, payment systems, individual portfolio management or lending activities; see question 4.5), the Collective Investment Schemes Act (if issuing or managing investment funds or engaging in other activities relating to collective investment schemes), the Financial Market Infrastructure Act (“FinMIA”) (if acting as a financial market infrastructure, e.g. a multilateral trading facility, or operating a DLT trading facility), the Financial Institutions Act (“FinIA”) (if acting as a securities firm, as an asset manager or trustee, see further below), the Financial Services Act (“FinSA”) (if engaging in so-called “financial services for clients”, e.g. investment advisory services) or the Insurance Supervision Act (“ISA”) (if acting as an insurer or insurance intermediary).\\xa0 Moreover, inter alia, the Consumer Credit Act, the Data Protection Act (“FADP”) as well as the National Bank Act may apply, as well as self-regulatory provisions or guidance papers by industry bodies (e.g. in the area of structured products with crypto underlyings).\\nDepending on the specific business model, regulatory requirements may include licence or registration requirements as well as ongoing compliance and reporting obligations, in particular relating to organisation, capital adequacy, liquidity and documentation, as well as general fit-and-proper requirements for key individuals, shareholders and the business itself.\\xa0 Certain types of regulated businesses are prudentially supervised by FINMA on an ongoing basis in a two-tier approach, whereby an audit firm (regulatory auditor) appointed by the supervised entity carries out regulatory audits that will be an important basis for the supervision by FINMA.\\xa0 The individual financial market laws provide for de minimis and other exemptions that can potentially be relevant for fintech businesses depending on the type and scale of their activities.\\nFINMA is the integrated supervisory authority for the Swiss financial market, ensuring a consistent approach to the qualification and regulatory treatment of fintech businesses and other financial institutions.\\xa0 Furthermore, Switzerland has an established system of industry self-regulation by private organisations such as the SBA, the AMAS as well as numerous professional self-regulatory and supervisory organisations for financial intermediaries, asset managers and trustees.\\xa0 Some of the regulations issued by self-regulatory organisations have been recognised by FINMA as minimum standards (e.g. in the area of money laundering prevention).\\n3.2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are financial regulators and policy-makers in your jurisdiction receptive to fintech innovation and technology-driven new entrants to regulated financial services markets, and if so how is this manifested?\\xa0 Are there any regulatory ‘sandbox’ options for fintechs in your jurisdiction?\\nKey representatives of FINMA have repeatedly expressed their openness in principle to innovation in financial services.\\xa0 At the organisational level, FINMA, inter alia, established a dedicated fintech desk to interact with fintech start-ups, and revised several of its circulars, which specify the practice of the regulator under the current legislation, to render them technology-neutral (e.g. by refraining from physical written form requirements relating to certain documentations or by enabling video and online identification for client onboarding purposes).\\xa0 In the context of AML, FINMA has also revised its respective ordinance, introducing simplified organisational requirements for small fintech companies (see question 4.5).\\nIn order to make it easier for fintech start-ups to set up shop and to ease regulatory hurdles, a three-pillar legal reform programme was initiated by Swiss policy-makers (including the Federal Council) back in 2016, with the first two pillars (see first and second bullets below) taking effect on 1 August 2017.\\xa0 The third pillar of the legislative reform package refers to the introduction of a fintech licence category to the Swiss framework for financial market supervision and became effective on 1 January 2019 (see third bullet below).\\n\\nMaximum holding period for settlement accounts: The revision of the framework for banking legislation extended the time period for which third-party monies accepted on interest-free accounts for the purpose of settlement of customer transactions do not qualify as “deposits from the public” (and therefore do not count towards a potential banking licence requirement) to a maximum of 60 days (instead of only seven days).\\xa0 Crowdfunding platforms in particular, but also payment service providers, the business model of which typically requires holding third-party funds for a certain period of time, benefit from this broadened exemption.\\xa0 It must be noted that settlement accounts of foreign exchange dealers generally do not fall within the scope of the exception for settlement accounts.\\xa0 In the context of fintech, this may in particular affect cryptocurrency traders, which are subject to the same limitation if their business is conducted in a manner comparable to a traditional foreign exchange dealer.\\nRegulatory sandbox: The Swiss regulatory sandbox provides an innovation space for fintech but also for other emerging businesses and other undertakings to test their business models.\\xa0 It allows any person, without the prior approval or review by the regulator (i.e. no licence requirement), to accept deposits from the public or engage in collective custody of cryptocurrencies in an amount or value of up to CHF 1 million, regardless of the number of depositors.\\xa0 This exemption is, however, available only if the deposits are neither interest-bearing nor invested (or alternatively used for the purpose of financing a primarily commercial or industrial activity).\\xa0 As a mitigating measure, the deposit-taker must inform the depositors – before accepting any of their monies – that it is not supervised by FINMA and that the deposits are not covered by the depositor protection regime.\\xa0 On 1 April 2019, new rules entered into force explicitly prohibiting the interest margin business while at the same time enabling deposits received under the sandbox to be used for private purposes (i.e. not for commercial or industrial purposes).\\nFintech licence: Under this licence category (sometimes also referred to as “banking licence light”), FINMA may authorise companies that do not carry out traditional banking activities to accept deposits from the public up to a maximum threshold of CHF 100 million as long as the deposits are not invested and no interest is paid on them.\\xa0 Hence, companies that merely accept and hold public deposits up to the threshold amount and do not engage in the commercial banking business with maturity transformation are eligible for the fintech licence.\\xa0 Compared to a fully-fledged banking licence, the fintech licence is subject to less onerous requirements in the areas of minimum capital, capital adequacy and liquidity, governance, risk management, compliance, depositor protection as well as accounting and auditing.\\xa0 Irrespective of the reliefs granted, AML regulation continues to apply to fintech firms if they qualify as financial intermediaries (the same applies to data protection law (see question 4.5)).\\xa0 We note that so far only five companies have obtained a fintech licence as the application scope of the fintech licence is, in practice, limited to certain business models.\\xa0 By way of the Federal Act on the Adaptation of Federal Law to Developments in the Technology of Distributed Electronic Registers (“DLT Act”), in 2021, the licence was expanded to, and is therefore required for, the business of collective custody of cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nIn addition, the DLT Act provides for a new regulatory licence type in the FinMIA for the operation of a DLT trading facility, defined as a professionally operated venue for the multilateral trading of DLT securities.\\xa0 According to Swiss law, DLT securities (from a regulatory point of view) include (a) register value rights in the meaning of art. 973d of the Swiss Code of Obligations, and (b) other value rights that are held on electronic registers and enable the creditors, but not the debtor, to dispose over their rights using technological processes.\\xa0\\nIn the insurance sector, the recently revised ISA, which entered into force in 2024, provides for a competence of FINMA to exempt small insurance undertakings with innovative business models under certain conditions from insurance supervision if this serves the sustainability of the Swiss financial market and the interests of the insured are safeguarded (regulatory sandbox in the insurance/insurtech sector).\\n3.3\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What, if any, regulatory hurdles must fintech businesses (or financial services businesses offering fintech products and services) which are established outside your jurisdiction overcome in order to access new customers in your jurisdiction?\\nThe introduction of the fintech legislation (see question 3.2) reduced certain regulatory hurdles for fintech businesses in Switzerland.\\xa0 In general, it can also be said that the Swiss inbound cross-border regulatory regime for financial services is fairly liberal in comparison to international regulation.\\xa0 Many Swiss financial market regulatory laws do not apply to fintech (and other) businesses that are domiciled abroad and serve customers in Switzerland on a pure cross-border basis, i.e. without employing persons permanently on the ground in Switzerland or by frequent travel to Switzerland.\\xa0 Notably, the BankA, FinIA and AMLA apply only to foreign operators that have established a relevant physical presence in Switzerland, e.g. a branch or representative office.\\xa0 That said, cross-border operators that are not regulated in Switzerland should refrain from creating an (inaccurate) appearance of “Swissness”, e.g. by using a “.ch” domain or referring to Swiss contact numbers or addresses (or such factors in combination).\\xa0 However, the Swiss financial services regulation pursuant to the FinSA also captures foreign financial service providers that service clients in Switzerland from abroad on a pure cross-border basis; a significant departure from the otherwise liberal regulatory inbound regime, albeit limited to certain defined types of financial services such as investment advice, investment management, the receipt and transmission of orders and the purchase and sale of financial instruments, as well as specific lending activities in this context.\\xa0 Separately, it must be noted that some areas of Swiss financial regulation are more restrictive with regard to cross-border activities, notably the regulation of collective investment schemes as well as insurance regulation and consumer credit regulation.\\n3.4\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How is your regulator approaching the challenge of regulating the traditional financial sector alongside the regulation of big tech players entering the fintech space?\\nThe Swiss Federal Council instructed the State Secretariat for International Finance to review the current regulatory framework and submit amendments to the financial market legislation with regard to innovative business models of financial institutions.\\xa0 The focus is, inter alia, on the fintech licence (see questions 3.2 and 3.3) and whether it should be amended to include payment service providers (including stablecoin) and providers of cryptoassets.\\xa0 Additional topics to be reviewed are Green Fintech or further use of DLT.\\xa0 The bill is currently being drafted and is to be submitted for public consultation in 2025 (see Federal Council, Digital finance: areas of action 2022+, February 2022, Appendix).\\n\\n4. Other Regulatory Regimes / Non-Financial Regulation\\n\\n4.1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does your jurisdiction regulate the collection/use/transmission of personal data, and if yes, what is the legal basis for such regulation and how does this apply to fintech businesses operating in your jurisdiction? \\nSwiss data protection law is set forth in the FADP and the implementing Data Protection Ordinance (“DPO”).\\xa0 The revised FADP and DPO entered into force on 1 September 2023.\\xa0 The main goal of the revision was to adapt Swiss data protection legislation to the changed technological and social conditions and, in particular, to improve the transparency of data processing and strengthen the rights and self-determination of data subjects.\\xa0 Furthermore, the revision served to align Swiss data protection legislation with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the EU (“GDPR”), as this was a key element to ensure continued EU recognition of Switzerland as a third country with an adequate level of data protection in order for cross-border data transfers to remain possible in the future without further protective measures.\\xa0 Fintech firms are subject to the FADP if they process personal data in Switzerland.\\xa0 In this context, the mere storage of personal data on a server in Switzerland is sufficient to trigger the applicability of the FADP.\\xa0 It is worth mentioning that Swiss data protection law is based on an “opt out” model, meaning that the processing of personal data is not allowed against the express wish of a data subject, but the consent of a data subject is, generally, not a requirement for lawful processing (subject to specific rules regarding the processing of particularly sensitive personal data).\\xa0 Recently and following the expansion of AI-supported data processing, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“Commissioner”) stated that the FADP is also directly applicable to its use (Commissioner, Current data protection legislation is directly applicable to AI, 9 November 2023).\\nA fintech firm (as with other businesses) processing personal data in Switzerland must do so in accordance with the following data processing principles: good faith; proportionality; purpose limitation; transparency; accuracy; data security; and lawfulness.\\xa0 This means personal data may only be processed for a specified and legitimate purpose (it is not permitted to collect personal data for unknown future purposes in bulk), the purposes, controller and recipients of the data must at least be transparent upon collection of the personal data (under the revised FADP, companies have an active duty to inform data subjects of all processing activities; the FADP sets out the minimum information that must be provided) and only the personal data necessary to achieve the purpose may be processed.\\xa0 The personal data should only be accessed on a strict need-to-know basis and deleted once it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected (subject to statutory retention duties).\\xa0 The revised FADP introduces additional duties that impact fintech firms processing personal data in Switzerland, similar to the duties under the GDPR.\\xa0 Fintech firms (as with other businesses) have to (i) maintain a register of all data processing activities (with certain exemptions), (ii) report certain data breaches to the Commissioner and, in certain cases, the affected data subjects, (iii) actively inform all data subjects of all data processing activities (i.e. through a detailed privacy policy) and, in certain circumstances, and (iv) conduct a so-called “data protection impact assessment” (i.e. a risk assessment) for high-risk processing activities.\\xa0 Furthermore, the processing of personal data by third-party service providers on behalf of a fintech firm is subject to the conclusion of a data processing agreement between the fintech firm and the third-party service provider.\\xa0 The data processing agreement should, in particular, ensure that the third-party service provider may only process the personal data for the same purposes as the fintech firm and that the third-party service provider ensures at least the same level of data security (by implementation of state-of-the-art technical and organisational data security measures).\\xa0 The parties should also ensure strict confidentiality, where possible and necessary.\\xa0 In particular, a fintech firm must ensure that consent of the affected customers is obtained if the fintech firm is subject to statutory or contractual confidentiality duties that would otherwise prevent the engagement of third-party service providers.\\xa0 Under the FADP, third-party services providers are, furthermore, required to obtain the fintech firm’s prior consent if the third-party service provider wants to engage sub-processors for the processing activities it is carrying out on behalf of the respective fintech firm.\\xa0 For the requirements regarding cross-border data transfers, see question 4.2 below.\\nFinally, companies must ensure that they have implemented processes to allow data subjects to exercise their rights in accordance with the FADP (in particular, the right to information/access, the right to correction of inaccurate/wrong personal data and the right to deletion of inaccurate/wrong personal data).\\xa0 The revised FADP introduces the right to data portability, similar to the GDPR.\\n4.2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do your data privacy laws apply to organisations established outside of your jurisdiction?\\xa0 Do your data privacy laws restrict international transfers of data?\\nSwiss data privacy laws apply to any natural or legal person who processes personal data, if the processing takes effect in Switzerland or impacts individuals in Switzerland, respectively (e.g. if personal data is collected or stored in Switzerland or the fintech firm offers products or services to data subjects in Switzerland).\\xa0 Therefore, the activity of processing of personal data on equipment located in Switzerland is, in principle, within the scope of the FADP (see question 4.1).\\xa0 This is particularly relevant for foreign fintech firms that are processing personal data in Switzerland through branch offices or third-party service providers.\\nThe FADP prohibits international data transfers if such a transfer could seriously endanger the privacy of the data subjects concerned.\\xa0 This could be the case particularly if personal data is disclosed to a country where the local legislation does not guarantee an adequate protection of personal data, e.g. India, China or the U.S. in case of non-certified companies.\\xa0 The Swiss Federal Council is the competent authority to issue binding decisions on the adequacy of a foreign country’s data protection laws. \\xa0The Federal Council has published a binding list of countries that provide an adequate level of data protection in annex 1 of the DPO.\\xa0 In particular, all EU Member States are deemed to meet the requirement of adequate data protection rules for the processing of personal data of individuals.\\xa0 If personal data is disclosed to a company in a country that does not provide an adequate level of data protection, other measures must be implemented to justify such a transfer.\\xa0\\nIn January 2024, the EU confirmed that Switzerland offers an adequate level of data protection, meaning that personal data will continue to circulate from the EU and the EEA to Switzerland without further need for guarantees.\\xa0 Similarly, later in August 2024, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework was approved.\\xa0 Switzerland can transfer personal data to self-certified U.S.-based companies without any additional guarantees.\\nAn important means to secure adequate protection for transfers to other countries is the use of standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) for the transfer of personal data to third countries issued by the European Commission, adapted to Swiss law requirements, or other contractual clauses explicitly recognised by the Commissioner.\\xa0 In June 2021, the European Commission published the revised SCCs, which were recognised by the Commissioner for Switzerland some weeks later.\\xa0 Before signing these new SCCs, Swiss companies need to implement the requirements published by the Commissioner (e.g. in a Swiss appendix) and they need to assess on a case-by-case basis whether the SCCs are actually suitable for ensuring appropriate protection of the transferred personal data or whether supplementary measures need to be in place in addition to the SCCs (a so-called “data transfer impact assessment”).\\xa0 In particular, Swiss companies exporting data need to evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether the laws in the receiving country relating to lawful data access by foreign public authorities (e.g. for national security or criminal investigation purposes) and data subject rights are compatible with Swiss data protection law and Swiss constitutional principles.\\xa0 Furthermore, international data transfers between entities of the same group are permitted if so-called “binding corporate rules” have been adopted by the entities and approved by the Commissioner.\\xa0 Under the FADP, the Commissioner must be notified of the use of model contracts (except if SCCs are used) for international transfers and binding corporate rules need to be approved by the Commissioner or another competent authority domiciled in a country that provides an adequate level of data protection prior to any transfers.\\xa0 Another option is to obtain explicit consent for the transfer from the data subject whose data is being transferred for individual cases.\\xa0 Companies are also permitted to transfer personal data abroad if it is necessary, for the respective company to establish, exercise or enforce legal claims before a foreign court or authority in a specific case, or if the transfer is directly connected to the conclusion or performance of a contract.\\xa0 The direct collection of personal data from a data subject in Switzerland by a fintech company based outside of Switzerland is not considered an international data transfer.\\n4.3\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Please briefly describe the sanctions that apply for failing to comply with your data privacy laws.\\nThe sanctions pursuant to the old FADP were moderate but have since been extended significantly pursuant to the revision of the FADP in 2023:\\n\\nCivil law sanctions: As under the old FADP, if the personality of a data subject has been violated (e.g. if personal data is not processed in compliance with the general data protection principles, personal data is disclosed to a third party without consent, a legal basis or an overriding interest, or if personal data is processed despite the data subject’s objection), then the data subject can lodge a civil claim.\\xa0 A data subject can file a request for an interim injunction against unlawful data processing.\\xa0 It is, inter alia, also possible to lodge a claim for correction or deletion of data or a prohibition on the disclosure of data to third parties.\\xa0 In addition, a data subject is entitled to compensation for actual damages caused by unlawful processing or other breaches of the FADP.\\nCriminal law sanctions: Under the revised FADP, the catalogue of criminal offences that can lead to a fine in case of wilful conduct has been extended (e.g. non-compliance with the requirements to engage a data processor or transfer personal data abroad, intentionally providing wrong or incomplete information, failure to comply with the minimum data security standards defined in the DPO, or if a company does not comply with the minimum standards of data security defined by the Federal Council) and the fines that can be imposed have been increased to up to CHF 250,000 (previously CHF 10,000).\\xa0 The Commissioner will still not have the competence to issue such fines but will be entitled to file a criminal complaint.\\xa0 The cantonal criminal law enforcement agencies are competent for issuing fines and they only become active in case they receive a complaint.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Commissioner now has the competence to issue binding orders against companies processing personal data in breach of the revised FADP.\\xa0 The Commissioner will, inter alia, have the power to restrict, suspend or terminate processing activities or to require companies to comply with their duties under the revised FADP.\\xa0 If companies do not comply with such binding orders, they can face a fine of up to CHF 250,000.\\xa0 Furthermore, the revised FADP has extended the catalogue of criminal offences.\\n4.4\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does your jurisdiction have cyber security laws or regulations that may apply to fintech businesses operating in your jurisdiction? \\nSwitzerland does not provide for comprehensive cyber security legislation.\\xa0 However, specific objects and specific industries are regulated with regard to cyber security by way of a number of provisions in different acts and initiatives, inter alia:\\n\\nUnder the revised FADP, the Federal Council has issued minimum standards of data security in the revised DPO that companies processing personal data will at least have to meet.\\xa0 Furthermore, the revised FADP provides for an obligation to notify the Commissioner and, where necessary, the affected data subjects of certain personal data breaches.\\nFintech firms subject to the supervision of FINMA also have a duty to report certain cyber security incidents to FINMA in accordance with art. 29 para. 2 of the Financial Market Supervision Act (see also FINMA guidance paper 05/2020).\\xa0 Further, on 7 June 2024, FINMA published guidance paper 03/2024 regarding findings from FINMA’s cyber risk supervision, clarification of FINMA guidance paper 05/2020 and scenario-based cyber risk exercises.\\nThe Criminal Code provides for statutory offences, which protect IT infrastructure against cyber crime (i.e. against the unauthorised obtaining of data, unauthorised access to a data processing system, data corruption, etc.).\\nThe National Cyber Security Centre is Switzerland’s competence centre for cyber security and thus the first contact point for businesses, public administrations, educational institutions and the general public for cyber issues.\\xa0 It is responsible for the coordinated implementation of the National Cyberstrategy ((Hyperlink) which was adopted by the Federal Council on 5 April 2023.\\xa0\\nThe Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport established a Cyber Defence Campus that commenced operations in January 2019, focusing on early detection and observation of current developments in the cyber world and on the development of action strategies in this respect.\\nOn 5 April 2022, the Swiss Financial Sector Cybersecurity Center was founded.\\xa0 It aims to enhance the financial sector’s ability to withstand cyber security risks – its cyber resilience – and promote a partnership between financial institutions and authorities on strategic and operational issues.\\xa0 The 55 founding members include banks, insurers and industry associations.\\nThe Federal Act on Information Security (“ISG”) “Bundesgesetz über die Informationssicherheit beim Bund”) was adopted on 18 December 2020 and entered into force on 1 January 2024.\\xa0 The ISG requires federal authorities subject to the ISG to report security incidents to the competent authority (“Fachstelle BS”).\\xa0 Additionally, the ISG provides the basis for a reporting obligation for critical infrastructures in case of cyber attacks.\\xa0 The “Cybersecurity Ordinance” implementing the ISG’s reporting obligation is to be submitted to the Federal Council for approval in 2025.\\nIn 2011, Switzerland ratified the Budapest Convention (Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime of 2001), which fosters increased and rapid international cooperation in the fight against cyber crime.\\n\\n4.5\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Please describe any AML and other financial crime requirements that may apply to fintech businesses in your jurisdiction. \\nThe Swiss rules on prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing are set forth in the AMLA, the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance, ordinances and circulars of FINMA as well as the rulebooks of recognised self-regulatory organisations.\\xa0 Generally speaking, AML regulation applies to so-called “financial intermediaries” (and partially to merchants if they accept large sums in cash, i.e. more than CHF 100,000, as payment in commercial transactions).\\xa0 On the one hand, certain prudentially regulated entities, such as banks, securities firms, fund management companies, life insurance undertakings and, with the introduction of the DLT Act, DLT trading systems, qualify as financial intermediaries based on their regulatory status (per se financial intermediaries).\\xa0 On the other hand, any otherwise unregulated person or entity can qualify as a financial intermediary by virtue of its professional activities.\\xa0 In general, this refers to any person that, on a professional basis, accepts or holds on deposit third-party assets or that assists in the investment or transfer of such assets (e.g. money transmitters or crypto exchanges, but also, depending on the particulars of the case, issuers of cryptocurrencies).\\xa0 The DLT Act also closed potential loopholes in the area of money laundering.\\xa0\\nMany fintech business models include elements that lead to their operators qualifying as financial intermediaries in the meaning of the AMLA.\\xa0 If this is the case and no exemptions are available, the fintech firm is required to join a recognised Swiss AML self-regulatory organisation.\\xa0 In this context, the firm is required to comply with certain duties on an ongoing basis, in particular the duty to verify the identity of customers and the beneficial ownership in the relevant assets as well as documentation, reporting and audit requirements.\\xa0 In a push to eliminate barriers for technology-based business models, FINMA introduced a circular that enables onboarding of customers via digital channels, e.g. by means of video transmission and other forms of online identification.\\xa0 This model has also been replicated in the rulebooks of recognised AML self-regulatory organisations.\\nThe AMLA includes specific criminal provisions sanctioning the violation of duties under AML regulation.\\xa0 In addition, certain offences in the area of corruption and money laundering are set forth in general criminal law, meaning that they apply to fintech (and other) firms regardless of their qualification as a financial intermediary.\\n4.6\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are there any other regulatory regimes that may apply to fintech businesses operating in your jurisdiction (for example, AI)?\\nAside from financial regulation in various areas (see questions 3.1 et seqq.) and the data protection regime (see questions 4.1 et seqq.), fintech firms have to comply with general corporate and civil law provisions as well as with Swiss competition law on the basis of the Unfair Competition Act (“UCA”).\\xa0 Furthermore, depending on the specific business model, the Telecommunications Act may apply.\\nAlthough there is currently no particular legislation concerning AI in place in Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Council has recognised the potential and risks of the technology and has commissioned an overview over possible regulatory approaches to AI based on current Swiss law, the EU’s AI Act and the Council of Europe’s AI Convention.\\xa0 The overview will act as basis for a potential regulatory proposal in 2025.\\xa0 At the supervisory level, FINMA, on 18 December 2024, published a guidance paper on governance and risk management for financial institutions using AI.\\n\\n5. Technology\\n\\n5.1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Please briefly describe how innovations and inventions are protected in your jurisdiction.\\nFintech inventions are predominantly protected either by copyright law or by patent law.\\xa0 Assuming that fintech products are typically based on computer programs – or more broadly, software – they are protected by copyright if they possess an individual character (i.e. if they are original).\\xa0 In practice, this criterion relates to the novelty or absence of triviality in comparison to existing computer programs.\\xa0 Copyrights in computer programs cover the source code and object code.\\xa0 However, the underlying ideas and principles as well as algorithms and formulas used in and for computer programs are not protected.\\xa0 Copyright protection in computer programs expires 50 years after the author deceases.\\xa0 Software that is integral to an invention may further be patented for a period of 20 years.\\xa0 However, computer programs per se are excluded from patentability.\\nIn addition, the design of fintech products (e.g. if implemented in portables, wearables, etc.) may be protected for a maximum period of 25 years by design rights.\\xa0 Fintechs may also seek protection under the Trademark Act and register graphical representations for the distinction of the company’s products or services during a period of 10 years (renewable).\\xa0 Marketable products are further protected by the UCA against technical reproduction processes and exploitation without appropriate effort on the part of the reproducing party.\\xa0 Unlike the laws of EU Member States, Swiss law does not provide for database rights.\\nThe protection of fintech inventions or innovation as trade and business secrets may also be based on statutory or contractual obligations.\\n5.2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Please briefly describe how ownership of IP operates in your jurisdiction.\\nAs a general rule, the primary owner of the copyright is the author, i.e. the natural person who created the work.\\xa0 Computer programs – or more broadly, software – are works as defined by Swiss copyright legislation.\\xa0 The copyright automatically vests in the author and exists informally upon the moment of intellectual creation; registration is not required.\\nIn case a computer program has been created under a contractual employment relationship in the course of fulfilling professional duties and contractual obligations, the employer alone is entitled to exercise the exclusive rights of use.\\xa0 Similar statutory rules apply as regards to designs and inventions (patents).\\xa0 However, unlike the situation regarding computer programs, the acquisition of inventions and designs is subject to the payment of an additional compensation to the employee if they have been created outside the performance of contractual obligations (mandatory claim).\\xa0 Outside employment relationships, the IP rights (copyrights) or the right to apply for IP protection (patents, designs) vest in the person who has created the work, inventions or design.\\n5.3\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In order to protect or enforce IP rights in your jurisdiction, do you need to own local/national rights or are you able to enforce other rights (for example, do any treaties or multi-jurisdictional rights apply)?\\nIn Switzerland, only (Swiss) national IP rights are enforceable.\\xa0 This also applies if an IP right has been applied for via an international application system (e.g. WIPO’s international patent system PCT or the international trademark system) or regional application system (e.g. patent applications under the European Patent Convention) and if Switzerland was chosen as the designated state in respective applications (the resulting rights are national rights, not multi-jurisdictional rights).\\n5.4\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How do you exploit/monetise IP in your jurisdiction and are there any particular rules or restrictions regarding such exploitation/monetisation? \\nIP rights are, as a general matter, exploited/monetised by means of assignment (transfer), licensing, and the granting of security interests.\\xa0 There are slightly different formalities for the various types of IP rights in respect of assignments and licences.\\xa0 Subject to the assignment of copyrights, an assignment must be in writing and signed by the assignor.\\xa0 The recording of the change of ownership in the relevant IP register is not a requirement for the assignment and transfer to the assignee but may be advisable since a change of ownership not recorded in the register is not relevant for persons who have acquired IP rights in good faith.\\xa0 The written form is not required for licence agreements in general.\\nBoth the licence agreements and the pledge agreements pertaining to trademarks, patents and designs may be entered in the relevant IP register at the request of one of the contractual parties.\\xa0 As a consequence, they become binding on any rights related to trademarks, patents and designs subsequently acquired.\\n\\n\\nProduction Editor\\'s Note\\n\\nThis chapter has been written by a member of ICLG\\'s international panel of experts, \\n                who has been exclusively appointed for this task as a leading professional in their field by Global Legal Group, ICLG\\'s publisher. \\n                ICLG\\'s in-house editorial team carefully reviews and edits each chapter, updated annually, and audits each one for originality, relevance and style, \\n                including anti-plagiarism and AI-detection tools. \\n                                This chapter was copy-edited by Oliver Chang, our in-house editor.\\n                                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead this chapter FREE\\nTo download this chapter FREERegister or log in here\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Buy Chapter in PDF format£100\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Buy the Book in PDF format£295\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        Contributors\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                          Daniel Flühmann\\n                            \\n\\n\\n\\n                                      Bär & Karrer Ltd.\\n                                  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                          Peter Ch.

This license is designed to lower entry barriers for fintech companies, enabling them to operate with reduced capital and liquidity requirements compared to full banking licenses. However, these companies cannot pay interest on deposits or engage in proprietary trading with client funds.\\n\\n2. **Regulatory Sandbox**: The Swiss regulatory framework includes a sandbox that permits fintech startups to accept public deposits up to CHF 1 million without requiring a banking or fintech license. This allows companies to test their business models in a controlled environment while ensuring that depositors are informed that their funds are not covered by the Swiss deposit insurance scheme.\\n\\n3. **Supportive Regulatory Environment**: The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has established a dedicated fintech desk to facilitate communication with startups and provide guidance on regulatory compliance. The regulatory approach is technology-neutral, allowing for flexibility in adapting to new business models, including those involving cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\\n\\n### References\\n- Global Legal Insights.
