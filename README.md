## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with `CH` followed by the chapter number. For example, CH01.
The notebooks are then organized as follows: `ch01_attention_mechanism_variations.ipynb`, where `ch01` indicates the chapter
and `attention_mechanism_variations` what is done in the notebook. 


## Repo structure

## Running the Notebooks

Every notebook contains buttons so that the notebook can be oppend and run on Google Colab like this:
